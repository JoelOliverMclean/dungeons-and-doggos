## Gil's Tankard
If Gil goes to check on the progress of his Large Tankard, he could possibly find out about the location of the [Tankard of Plenty](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:tankard-of-plenty).

## The Disappearance/Discovery of Dwayne
At a random point, Mhazhique is accosted by a group of mercenaries (bandits) attempting to steal Dwayne. If they manage to interrogate any of them, an intimidation DC 17 or a persuasion DC 17 will lead to the mercenary telling them they were hired by someone in the Xanathar guild to recover a small rock from a Tiefling warlock called Mhazhique who recently acquired Trollskull Manor. Otherwise they keep shtum to maintain their reputation as discrete mercenaries.

At another point, if not recovered by the mercenaries, a larger group of Xanathar Guild Thugs will ambush Mhazhique and attempt to take Dwayne again. If the party defeats them, a DC 13 Investigation check on the bodies will uncover Xanathar tattoos (identifiable on a DC 13 History Check).

If both attempts fail and the party don't find Nar'l's lab within 24 hours, a Xanathar guild rogue thief [[Kael Thorne]] will steal the rock from Mhazhiques belt. Mhazhique has to make a perception check DC 17 to see if he feels the theft and spots the thief, who immediately flees. If this happens he is too quick to pursue and seemingly disappears after turning a corner - but an investigation DC 15 of the street/alley he turns on to reveals a note with instructions, signed by Nar'l.

  > [!cite] Note from Nar'l
  > Thuggery has failed. I call upon you to utilise your expertise in the shadows to retrieve this precious artefact in a more subtle manor. Do not disappoint. Xanathar is watching. As am I. Nar'l
