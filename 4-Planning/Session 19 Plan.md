## 1. The previous session
- At the end of the previous session - the party, besides Mhazhique, had settled down for a long rest after their previous attempt was rudely interrupted by a small wolf pack. The party dispatched of them with the help of their current companion "Friend". 
- Flick, whilst on watch, decided to peruse his book ([[The Grimoire of Taz'Rhul]]) and the resulting checks and events resulted in him falling asleep, and seemingly subconsciously summoning a earth elemental guardian that stood between him and the rest of the camp. 
- Gil attempted to throw a small inconsequential stone at Flick past the guardian but failed, the guardian whacking it away casually. 

## 2. Start and goals
- We start tonight's session as one by one the party comes round from their restful slumber. Health rejuvenated, abilities and magic restored, the majority of the party spy the earth elemental guardian before Flick, just before the moment he awakens, in which the guardian seemingly vanishes in a swirl of darkness and shadow. A perception check (or passive) of **DC 15** notes that these swirls seem to withdraw into the book clutched to Flick's chest before he instinctively grasps and stows the book away in his pack as he awakens. 
- The party's current aims are split - they want to investigate the strange explosive sounds coming from a distance away, but equally want to get out of this never-ending forest and back to their compatriot Mhazhique, in order to continue the pursuit of Nar'l. 
- "Friend" was in possession of a book, which the party have since recovered from the rubble of the house they burned down (becoming a habit). Which supposedly detailed a ritual or sorts, to reopen the door from which they entered this forest. The caveat being one person must remain behind to hold the ritual to keep the door open. Do the party sacrifice one of their own, try to convince "Friend" to stay behind once more, or try find a way to get everyone out. 

## 📝 **Session Prep Notes: "Escape from the Neverending Forest"**

### **Scene 1: Morning at Camp**

- **Visual Details:**
    
    - Early morning mist, faintly glowing embers from the night's fire.
        
    - Disturbed earth and heavy indentations marking where the guardian stood.
        
- **Key Events:**
    
    - Flick wakes confused and unaware of the guardian incident.
        
    - Lord Cock and Gil explicitly saw the guardian during Flick’s watch, chained and protective, disappearing as Flick awoke.
        
    - Potential confrontation: Lord Cock and Gil question Flick about the book and his curse, prompting character dialogue and party tension.

### **Scene 2: Reading Friend’s Ritual Book**

- **Description of the Book:**
    
    - Worn leather, faded silver runes, chaotic notes in Friend’s handwriting.
        
- **Ritual Page (Handout for Players):**
    
    > _"Returneth through veil and shadow bound,  
    > To homeward passage, long unfound.  
    > Threefold price must first be paid,  
    > A binding anchor thus be laid._
    > 
    > _A Root that lives, breathes, and stirs,  
    > Captured Echoes, past magic spurs,  
    > Tear of loss, pure and deep,  
    > Secrets sorrowed, freely weep._
    > 
    > _Yet linger must one soul behind,  
    > By anchor chained, by oath entwined,  
    > Till passage closed or anchors spun—  
    > Thus ends the rite, once begun."_
    
- **Out of character notes:** Initially suggests the sacrifice clearly, but subtle margin notes (from Friend’s scribbles) vaguely hint: "Could Oakheart’s heart set one free?"

### **Scene 3: Meeting Oakheart**

- **Visual Details:**
    
    - Immense ancient tree-being, moss-covered, slow yet powerful.
        
    - Deep, amber eyes reflect profound wisdom and sadness.
        
- **Oakheart’s Backstory:**
    
    - Bound eternally by Nar’l’s pact, guardian of the Neverending Forest.
        
    - Explosions reveal a constant battle against a malevolent corruption—twisted spirits or aberrations periodically assaulting him.
        
    - Oakheart mournfully hints at betrayal by Nar’l, worried his original home may soon be unprotected.
        
- **Hidden Solution (Roleplay-triggered):**
    
    - Players must specifically show empathy and trustworthiness.
        
    - With sufficient roleplay, Oakheart gifts them a splinter of his magical heartwood—able to anchor the ritual permanently, removing need for personal sacrifice.

### **Scene 4: Gathering Ritual Components**

- **Living Root:** Easily given by Oakheart if friendly, hostile negotiation if mistrustful.
    
- **Crystalized Echoes:** Players must carefully capture the explosive magical residue, timing and positioning essential (Dexterity/Arcana checks).
    
- **Tear of Genuine Loss:** Roleplay moment, heartfelt interaction, Friend can provide tear if needed.

### **Optional Combat Encounter: The Source of Explosions**

- **Situation:** Players witness an explosion nearby—Oakheart under direct assault by malevolent, corrupted entities (shadowy aberrations or twisted magical constructs conjured by Nar’l to test/control him).
    
- **Combat details:**
    
    - Players must defend Oakheart from this wave of enemies.
        
    - Success deepens trust and gratitude, failure complicates obtaining the heartwood.
        
- **Adjust encounter length based on time constraints**—scale number of enemies or threat level accordingly.

### **Scene 5: Performing the Ritual**

- **Visual and Roleplay Details:**
    
    - Circle drawn with charcoal from cottage ruins.
        
    - Components placed meticulously, ritual chanting enacted by players.
        
- **Ritual Execution (Recited by DM or Players):**
    
    > _"By charcoal traced, we bind the spell,  
    > Summon homeward path and quell.  
    > By living root, by echoes held,  
    > By sorrow’s tear, the spell compelled._
    > 
    > _Anchor now, eternal rest,  
    > Chains unbound by hidden crest.  
    > Passage open, through worlds unroll—  
    > No soul remains, for tree-heart’s toll."_
    
- **Player Puzzle-Solving:**
    
    - Encourage players to recall Oakheart’s hint or find scribbled clues to prevent sacrificing someone.
        
    - Allow checks if stuck (Insight/Arcana).

### **Conclusion: Portal Opens**

- Portal manifests as swirling blue-green energy, players step through safely without leaving anyone behind.
    
- Oakheart emotionally thanks players, pleading for help on the Material Plane someday, planting seeds for future adventures.
