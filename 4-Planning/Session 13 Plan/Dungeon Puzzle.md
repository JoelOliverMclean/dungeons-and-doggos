A chair in a room, the walls lined with bookcases populated with a scattering of books. 

To solve the puzzle, there is a button under the chair. That causes 1 bookcase to swivel round revealing another side to it containing various items (the goblins treasure)

Various mis-directions in the room include books that look like they stick out, torches on the wall above the book cases, stone floor flags that seem to move, and a plaque on the wall above the door that reads "Chair is there, sit and stare, book by book, button where?"
