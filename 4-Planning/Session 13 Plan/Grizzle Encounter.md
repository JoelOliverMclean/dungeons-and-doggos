If the party successfully kill the hideout minions, they can encounter [[Grizzle Shadowbane]]

If they defeat him, they will find a set of keys, one to his chambers, and one to a room containing the puzzle (his treasure).

If they look to be defeated or about to be, Grizzle will stop short of killing them and give them the chance to leave.
