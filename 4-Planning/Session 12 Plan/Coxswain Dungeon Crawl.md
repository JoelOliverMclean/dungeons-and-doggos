## Entrance

- If [[Grizzle Shadowbane]] and the bandit captains get away with Dwayne, they will escape via the entrance to a subterranean network that's located in the basement of the tavern (the door opposite the one going into the room where Geoff found them)
- In the basement is a trapdoor covered by a barrel, this uncovers a ladder leading down to a small room with a door that has no handle. 
```
As you dismount the ladder and enter the small square room you look around and see stone walls, a dirt floor, a single wall-mounted torch and a door set back into one wall straight ahead. The door has no handle and has some carvings on it. There are footprints leading up to the door from the ladder.
```
- If players investigate the door they glean the following:
	- DC 5 Investigation - among the carvings is a name written in Infernal - "[[Bri'eth Carnor]]"
	- DC 10 Investigation - among the carvings is the symbol of the [[Xanathar Guild]]
	- DC 15 Arcana - the symbols are reminiscent of a soulbind ritual 
- If players speak the name [[Bri'eth Carnor]] the door morph's and a wooden mouth forms in the wood, creaking and moaning saying "I just let you in what do you wa... oh, you're not Grizzle... who are you?"
	- Speaking to [[Bri'eth Carnor]] the players can learn through charisma checks, failed charisma checks result in [[Bri'eth Carnor]] attempting to make small talk:
		- DC 5 - Why he ended up trapped in a door (sick joke, "trap door haha")
		- DC 10 - Who they are chasing and who they work for
		- DC 15 Charisma - Whispers of the "core" and getting it back to [[Nar'l Xibrindas]]
	- Speaking his name again muffles him
	- If the players attempt to persuade him to open for them:
		- DC 15 Charisma - He tells them he's not locked and just to push him open, but beware there's a lot of bandits in there and he'd much rather they stay and chat
		- DC 10 Charisma - He gives them an easy riddle
		- DC 5 Charisma - He gives them a hard riddle
- If the players push the door, it opens, however it is invulnerable to magic. 
	- If [[Bri'eth Carnor]] has already been revealed he protests and asks them to stay and chat as he's lonely, the bandits never speak to him.
	- If he hasn't then the "door" makes a muffled protest
