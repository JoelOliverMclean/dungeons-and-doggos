### **Amulet of Random Polymorph**

- **Effect**: Once per long rest, the wearer can cast _Polymorph_ on themselves. However, instead of choosing the form, the DM rolls randomly from a list of beasts (CR 1 or lower).
- **Twist**: The form chosen is random and can range from helpful (e.g., a Giant Eagle) to hindering (e.g., a Rat). The transformation lasts for up to 1 hour or until the wearer drops to 0 HP in that form.
- **Flavor**: The wearer can never predict what form they’ll take, perfectly embodying the chaotic nature of trickery.

### Amulet of Chaotic Inspiration**

- **Effect**: Once per short rest, the wearer can roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, they gain advantage on their next attack, skill check, or saving throw. On a roll of 4-6, they gain disadvantage instead.
- **Twist**: If they roll a 6, the disadvantage affects not only them but also a nearby ally (within 30 feet).
- **Flavor**: The amulet offers the temptation of gaining an advantage, but the wearer risks causing more harm than good if luck isn’t on their side.

### Amulet of Trickster’s Trick**

- **Effect**: Once per day, the wearer can cast _Mirror Image_ to create illusory duplicates of themselves. These duplicates confuse attackers and provide a layer of protection.
- **Twist**: There’s a 20% chance that the duplicates will act mischievously, drawing attention to the wearer instead of distracting enemies, such as taunting them or making loud noises.
- **Flavor**: This amulet is a great defensive tool but embodies the chaotic trickery of the god, with a chance to cause more problems than it solves.

### **Amulet of Chaotic Familiar**

- **Effect**: Once per long rest, the wearer can summon a random familiar for up to 1 hour. The familiar’s form is determined by rolling on a table of small creatures (such as a bat, cat, owl, rat, or spider).
- **Twist**: The familiar has a mischievous streak, sometimes ignoring commands or playing tricks on the wearer and others (e.g., running away, stealing items, or causing distractions).
- **Flavor**: This amulet grants the user a familiar, but the creature’s behavior is chaotic and unpredictable, reflecting the god's influence.

### **Amulet of Coin Flip**

- **Effect**: The wearer can flip a coin as a bonus action once per long rest. If heads, they gain advantage on their next attack or saving throw. If tails, they gain disadvantage on their next attack or saving throw.
- **Twist**: The coin flip result is unknown until the moment they roll, adding an element of risk to the gamble.
- **Flavor**: A simple, playful item that offers a gamble on luck—perfect for a follower of a trickster god who enjoys taking risks.

### **Amulet of Subtle Invisibility**

- **Effect**: The wearer can turn invisible for up to 1 minute, once per long rest. This effect ends if they attack or cast a spell.
- **Twist**: The invisibility sometimes only affects part of the wearer’s body (DM’s choice), leaving something like a floating hand or foot visible.
- **Flavor**: A trickster's way of hiding, but with the added whimsy of not always being as invisible as they’d hope.

### **Amulet of Paradox**

- **Effect**: This amulet allows the wearer to exist in two places at once for a brief period. Once per long rest, the wearer can take two turns simultaneously during a single round of combat, effectively creating a temporal split. Both versions of the wearer are independent, but they must re-merge by the end of the round.
- **Twist**: After using the ability, there’s a 25% chance that the wearer becomes temporally unstable, resulting in random moments where they vanish for a few seconds, reappearing in a random nearby location. This lasts until they complete a long rest.
- **Flavor**: The god’s love of paradox and confusion is embodied in this amulet, granting incredible power at the cost of destabilizing reality itself for the wearer.

### **Amulet of the Silver Tongue**

- **Effect**: Grants the wearer proficiency in Deception, Persuasion, and Insight checks. They can cast _Charm Person_ and _Suggestion_ once per day without using a spell slot.
- **Twist**: Any time the wearer fails a Charisma check, they are compelled to tell a minor truth or reveal a personal secret to whomever they are talking to.
- **Flavor**: The amulet heightens the wearer’s gift of gab, but the chaotic nature of the god ensures that their silver tongue sometimes betrays them.

### **Amulet of Shifting Faces**

- **Effect**: The wearer can alter their appearance at will, mimicking any humanoid they've seen within the past 24 hours. This change is undetectable by magic unless using a Wish or a similar spell of ultimate power.
- **Twist**: Once per day, the amulet forces a random transformation, making the wearer adopt the face of a random humanoid nearby, whether they’ve seen them or not. This lasts for an hour.
- **Flavor**: The amulet represents the ever-changing nature of trickery, giving the user the ability to deceive others, while also playing tricks on the wearer.
