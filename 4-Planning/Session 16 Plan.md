### Recap
With **Dwayne still missing**, **funds running low**, and multiple leads to chase, the Fearless Five set out to **secure their future**.

- The party uncovered a connection between a local **gambling den, The Sleeping Snake, and stolen jewelry**.
- **Flick briefly tested his luck at dice to get access to a higher stakes game which led to Mhazhique using suggestion to con a gambler out of 500+ gold**, securing much-needed funds.
- **Geoff recruited Waterdeep’s stray cats** to track down the missing **Lord Fluffington**.
- **Mhazhique** was pulled aside by the halfling looking fellow he had met in a jail cell, who provided a **crucial lead** and a **request**—a Xanathar mage named **Nar’l** working for the **Xanathar Guild** is likely tied to Dwayne’s disappearance, and he has the halflings's hat - he also revealed his name to be **Trilby**.
- Finally, the party **paid off their tavern’s debts early**, securing the **Troll’s Sack’s grand opening in 10 days**.

Now, with the tavern renovations paid off, **Geoff's spycat network** of Waterdeep on the **Lord Fluffington** case and **fresh leads on Dwayne**, the question remains—**where to next?**

### Possible next steps
1. **Investigate the Xanathar Guild & Nar’l’s lab** to rescue **Dwayne**.
2. **Follow up with the cat spy network** to locate **Lord "Fluffs" Fluffington**.
3. **Infiltrate the stolen jewelry warehouse**.
4. **Prepare for the grand opening of the Troll’s Sack**.
