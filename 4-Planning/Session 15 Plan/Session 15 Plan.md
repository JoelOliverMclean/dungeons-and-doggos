## Introduction and Catchup
When last we played, twas a short session; after defeating a band of Goblins in a hideout beneath [[The Angry Coxswain]] inn, you had solved a riddle in a locked room, revealing a chest of treasure including some magic items and other items of worth. [[Duun Shadowdwell|Duun]], the dwarven cleric who you had freed from the jails in the hideout, confused by the relatively small force of Goblins and complete lack of appearance from [[Grizzle Shadowbane|Grizzle]], urged you all to leave in-case this be a trap of some sort. [[Mhazhique Waand|Mhazhique]] remained frustrated and distraught at the loss and so-far-unsuccessful recovery of [[Dwayne]].

You reluctantly left, but not before fulfilling a promise to a sombre door named [[Bri'eth Carnor]], who longed only for the conversation of those who passed through his way. You freed him of his 2-way hinges and proceeded to carry him all the way home to [[The Troll's Sack]] where after a sleep you awoke to contractors beginning work on the tavern. You found [[Jeremy Irons]] supervising the project, and informed him of your intention to install [[Bri'eth Carnor]] as 1 of the front doors of the tavern and instructed him to see it done. He agreed after some confusion and you left on your merry way, leaving [[Bri'eth Carnor]] and his attempts to commune with the contractors met with looks of confusion and some jumps of fright. 

You made your way to [[Blackstaff Tower]] as [[Lord Maji Cock|Cock]] had seemingly forgotten (or thought it unimportant) to hand in the info he had gotten from [[hlam-wdh|Hlam]]. Vajra, at first unimpressed, took the information gladly, and despite the lateness of the hand-in, offered [[Lord Maji Cock|Cock]] an invitation to join [[Force Grey (Gray Hands)]] and become a protector in the making. We pick up as you all leave [[Blackstaff Tower]], groggy from a late-night carrying a door back home through the streets of Waterdeep, and now the day is yours to do with what you will. 

With errands undone, people to meet, money to earn and Dwayne still missing, what will The Fearless Five do now? Remember; time is precious.
