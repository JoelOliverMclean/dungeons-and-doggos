## Faction Invites

### [[Flick McPlumbs|Flick]] ([[Harpers]])
Receives a message in the form of a paper bird that flies to him (give paper bird)

## The Rock Conspiracy
The group were jumped by a small group of mercs who after being defeated, told them they were told to recover a rock in a leather pouch from a tiefling by a mysterious hooded goblin at the Angry Coxswain. And to meet him the next night to hand over the spoils. However he agreed to tell the goblin he had failed, the party plans to confront the goblin.

At the angry coxswain, if not recovered by the mercenaries, a larger group of Xanathar Guild Thugs will ambush Mhazhique and attempt to take Dwayne again. If the party defeats them, a DC 13 Investigation check on the bodies will uncover Xanathar tattoos (identifiable on a DC 13 History Check).

If both attempts fail and the party don't find Nar'l's lab within 24 hours, a Xanathar guild rogue thief [[Kael Thorne]] will steal the rock from Mhazhiques belt. Mhazhique has to make a perception check DC 17 to see if he feels the theft and spots the thief, who immediately flees. If this happens he is too quick to pursue and seemingly disappears after turning a corner - but an investigation DC 15 of the street/alley he turns on to reveals a note with instructions, signed by Nar'l.

 > [!cite] Note from Nar'l
 > Thuggery has failed. I call upon you to utilise your expertise in the shadows to retrieve this precious artefact in a more subtle manor. Do not disappoint. Xanathar is watching. As am I. Nar'l
