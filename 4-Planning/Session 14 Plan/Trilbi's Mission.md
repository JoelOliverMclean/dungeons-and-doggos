### The Situation
Mhazhique is feeling down about Dwayne being gone and as the party levels he attempts to reach his patron. After a frustrated waste of time (no answer) Trilbi shows up with an offer.

### The Offer
> [!note]+ Read Aloud as Trilbi
> Ello again, little birdy told me you've lost a friend. I might just have the info you seek, but there's something I want and I think you and your friends are more than capable of helping me out. What'd you say? 

Trilbi knows the location of [[Nar'l's Lab]] where they're holding Dwayne and tasks the party with also retrieving something stolen from him. A hat, worn by the wizard [[Nar'l Xibrindas]], he is unable to get close himself so needs you to help retrieve the hat. Trilbi describes the hat as very fancy and important to him.
