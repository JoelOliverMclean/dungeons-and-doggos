This is a hat of Trilbi's own making (not that he says so, nor what it does)

The hat is magical and has several properties attributed to the wearer, but it is also binding. (Kinda cursed, kinda not)

Upon wearing the hat, the wearer will find that he is unable to remove it willingly, and will involuntarily stop anyone else from removing it. Other than this, it has no effect on a player's actions, will or personality. The hat grants +2 to AC, advantage on wisdom saving throws.

### **Boons:**

1. **Trilbi's Favor**
    - Once per long rest, the wearer can call on Trilbi’s favor, granting them advantage on a skill check, attack roll, or saving throw of their choice. Trilbi’s voice echoes in their mind when this happens, offering cryptic or playful commentary.
2. **Hatted Presence**
    - The wearer gains proficiency in Performance or Persuasion (player’s choice). If they are already proficient, they instead gain expertise. Trilbi’s natural charisma enhances their ability to influence others, as they exude an air of charm.
3. **Hat Trick**
    - As a bonus action, the wearer can magically store or retrieve a non-living, handheld object in the hat. This could include weapons, tools, or even a few small mundane items. It functions like a tiny Bag of Holding but only for objects no larger than 10 pounds and must fit in the hat’s brim.
4. **Trilbi’s Ward**
    - Once per long rest, when the wearer is reduced to 0 hit points but not outright killed, the hat magically shields them, restoring 10 hit points and pushing all hostile creatures within 10 feet of them back 10 feet.
5. **Arcane Veil**
    - The wearer is surrounded by an invisible magical aura. They have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and when in dim light or darkness, they are considered lightly obscured from creatures relying on sight.
6. **Trilbi's Trickery**
	- The hat grants +2 to AC and advantage on wisdom saving throws.

### **Drawbacks/Quirks:**

1. **Trilbi's Will**
    - Once per long rest, Trilbi can take control of the wearer for 1 minute, forcing them to perform an action of his choosing. This might be subtle (e.g., persuading someone to buy a fancy hat) or overt (e.g., sabotaging an ally’s plan). The DM determines when and why Trilbi exercises this control.
2. **Hat-Bound**
    - The hat cannot be removed by the wearer unless Trilbi wills it. The wearer will also involuntarily stop anyone else from removing it with everything they have.
1. **Meddling Deity**
    - Trilbi may occasionally offer “advice” or demand tasks, distracting the wearer. At the DM’s discretion, the wearer may have disadvantage on an Insight or Investigation check as Trilbi chatters in their mind about irrelevant or frivolous matters.

### **Optional Customization for Warlocks:**

- If the wearer is a warlock, the Hat of Trilbi can serve as their Arcane Focus. Additionally, Trilbi grants access to a unique Eldritch Invocation:
    - **Trilbi's Hat Mastery**
        - Prerequisite: Hat of Trilbi, 7th level.
        - You can cast **Disguise Self** at will and **Polymorph** once per long rest without expending a spell slot, provided you are wearing the Hat of Trilbi.
