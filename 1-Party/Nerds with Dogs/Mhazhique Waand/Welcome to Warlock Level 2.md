## Class Progression 

Aside from the 2 eldritch invocations, you also gain an additional 1st level spell known and an additional spell slot (so you now have 2). See below for a list of available 1st Level Warlock spells. The ones available to you are those with no sub-class, or with "The Fiend" sub-class
