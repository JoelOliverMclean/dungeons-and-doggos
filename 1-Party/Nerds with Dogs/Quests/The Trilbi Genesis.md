1. After stealing Dwayne the Elemental, the Xanathar guild sets out to make the party's life a living hell. 
2. Living in Waterdeep becomes impossible with their influence, the manor gets trashed, their name is tarnished by rumour and eventually a warrant is put out for their arrest by the city guard for crimes against Waterdeep and it's people. 
3. Trilbi offers them a way out but they must leave this life behind 
4. If they party accepts, Trilbi takes off his hat, pulling a bigger hat from his hat and places it on the ground, the inside fills with purple smoke. He asks them to step in 1 at a time and once through, wait for him and he'll tell them what to do next.
5. They all step in (I hope) and wait for Trilbi, but he never appears, instead after some time approaching them is an old tortle who says he's been expecting you but not this early and says come come, we have rooms ready for you and food and drink.
6. Maybe the mountains have a carving of the party in them.
