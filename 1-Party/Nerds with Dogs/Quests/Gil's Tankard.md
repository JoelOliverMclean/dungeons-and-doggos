## [[Embric]]'s Hint
- Gil finds a note left at [[The Troll's Sack]] from [[Embric]] saying his Tankard is ready
- On collecting the large custom tankard, [[Embric]] tells Gil of a relic he's heard of called the [[Tankard of Plenty]] 
- He says he heard rumour that it resides in Waterdeep in the possession of a Noble Dwarf who is a right nasty piece of work, treats his manor's staff like trash, they often complain about him in the [[Vicious Vixen]] tavern in the Castle Ward.
