## Breadcrumbs
- Maji may at any random point make a perception check (being watched by a dark red hooded figure)
- If he pursues the figure will flee, disappear around a corner and drop behind a piece of parchment. 
- The parchment is a letter containing details about Maji's movements. It is signed X and addressed to Lerrick. The parchment also contains on the reverse an embossed logo of a letter with wings.
