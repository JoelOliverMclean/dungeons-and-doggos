## An Evening at the [[Lightsinger Theater]]
- On arrival at the theatre for the performance of **The Fall of Tiamat** (an opera sang in giant describing the evil dragon queen's defeat at the Well of Dragons), the party sits through the first part until the interval and then finds their way to the box mentioned in the note. 
- Waiting for them in the box is [[Mirt]] , a robust and jovial figure with a commanding presence. 
- He has an offer of membership to the [[Harpers]] for Flick 
- If accepted, he gives Flick a silver pin of a harp within a crescent moon and his first mission.
