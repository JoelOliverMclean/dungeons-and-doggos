## A Quiet Drink
- Arriving at [[The Yawning Portal]], [[Davil Starsong]] would immediately call out Gil and gesture him over to the table he is sat at with [[Yagra Stonefist]].
- Asks him how he's doing and if he wants a drink
- Gets straight to the point, speaks in riddles about the organisation he represents (The [[Zhentarim]])
- He offers Gil membership to the [[Zhentarim]] and gives him his first mission

## The First Mission
*"Someone is killing elf and half-elf sailors in the Dock Ward-three dead so far, each one decapitated by a blade in the dead of night. Look into it, will you? Methinks the City Watch could use a little help."*

#### Requirements
Characters who spend three consecutive nights loitering around the docks spot Heldar, a drunk half-elf sailor ([bandit](app://obsidian.md/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md)), leaving the Muleskull Tavern (on Ship Street in the Dock Ward). Characters who follow Heldar can save him from [Soluun Xibrindas](app://obsidian.md/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/soluun-xibrindas-wdh.md), a renegade [drow gunslinger](app://obsidian.md/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow-gunslinger-wdh.md) (see appendix B). Soluun hides in the shadows, blade drawn, waiting for the half-elf to stumble by. Spotting him before he strikes requires a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. Soluun flees if reduced to half his hit points or fewer. _Reward_: Each Zhentarim character gains 1 renown. If Heldar survives Soluun's attack, each character receives 50 gp.
