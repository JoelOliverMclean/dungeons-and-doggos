## Backstory
Adopted and raised by 3 professors, burgeoning fellows of the School of the Arcane at the University of Poppleferry, Maji grew up surrounded by a font of knowledge, magic and pomposity. Much of his early life memories involve helping his adoptive guardians with their studies, something he found fascinating the older he grew. He spent his extra curricular time playing with a young understudy of one of the professors, Terrence, and formed a special bond with the University mascot, Popple XII; an energetic Mastiff dog, 12th of his name. 

As he grew into his formative years as a teen, he found himself growing frustrated with his guardians as he noticed them growing ever more distant to the point where they only really conversed with him when he was helping them with their studies and he could sense an air of frustration among them too. He withdrew himself more and more, burying his head in the books in the library of the university. With his guardians becoming more neglectful, Maji noticed even more the lack of family feeling he had, the only times he felt so was with Terrence and Popple XII. However, reaching his mid teens, Popple XII passed away.

Maji didn't take this well, he would refuse to cooperate with his guardians research and they would react with corporal punishment behind closed doors and further neglect and sanctions. But Maji would still sneak out to the library for solace amongst his books. One late night in the library, he found a book on a type of magic known as Necromancy. With the recent death of Popple XII and a growing sense of curiosity about his birth parents, about whom he had been having flickers of memories, he took a keen interest in this branch of the arcane and made it his sole focus to learn it and try to use it to bring back his parents from the dead. But he had to practice first and with the death of Popple XII still raw he decided to try and bring his old friend back from the dead.

He snuck out to the forest and dug him up from the Pet Cemetery at the borders of the university grounds where there stood many plinths to Popple XIIs ancestors and more. Brought him to a quiet room in the university near the library and begun his first ritual.

Success!! The body of Popple XII breathed back to life and after a brief moment of stiff and lethargic movement, suddenly Popple XII became frightened and confused, leapt to his feet and focussed on the only perceived threat in the room; Maji. Frothing at the mouth, Popple XII leaped towards him and began attacking, Maji managed to get the book he had been using between him and the dog and the dog gripped it between his teeth and started to rag him and the book around.

It was at this point that the door flung open, and in ran Terrence who shouted in shock, rushing forward to help his friend. Popple XII, outnumbered, took a quick look around and saw the open door and made a run for it. Terrence, helped Maji to his feet, shaking with shock and visible fear. Terrence had been sent to find him by his professor as they had noticed he was missing from his room. 

Maji pleaded with Terrence to leave with him, not wanting to go back to his neglective abusive guardians any more. There was a brief pause but Terrence agreed. He told Maji to run to the forest and wait for him as he would return to the professors, tell them he failed to find him and then quickly pack their bags and leave. 

Maji made it to the forest, waited a very anxious hour, but then saw Terrence approach with a small satchel over each shoulder. He threw one towards Maji and said they have to go now, the rest of the town of Poppleferry was the other side of the forest, and lights were starting to alight at the university and raised voices were heard as Terrence said "Now!" - the two turned and ran into the forest and ran until they hit the city. 

There they found the first cart out of Poppleferry and made their own way in the world. Seemingly not further pursued and found themselves in the oceanside city of Tindleport. It was here that they then boarded a passenger ferry leaving for the next continent - Terrence had told Maji of a great city filled with knowledge and secrets over the ocean known as Waterdeep, and twas there they headed. 

During a rough ride over the ocean with a lot of sea sickness for both, one night when the oceans were calm they felt able to take in the sea air, they stood together talking about their upcoming quest for knowledge when they were both grabbed from behind a hand in each of their coats. And a voice behind them spoke in Terrence's ear. Maji couldn't make it out fully, something about getting away with it and a special boy. The next thing Maji knew he was thrown into a cupboard below deck, the door seemingly barred as the man took Terrence with him.

What must have been hours, maybe days, Maji awoke having seemingly passed out, at the feet of the man who grabbed him and Terrence. They were no longer aboard the boat. He could hear the turning of cart wheels and bustling street crowds and as he looked around he realised he was in the back of a cart with the man, rolling through the streets of a city he didn't recognise. 

The man had bound Maji's legs and arms, he looked rough, a bald tattooed thuggish figure and as the cart came to a halt, the man noticed Maji was awake. He pulled out a waterskin, shoved it into Maji's mouth to make him drink, and after putting it away, through Maji over his shoulder and jumped down off the cart. He took him through a set of iron gates into a yard of some sort and entered a warehouse. In the warehouse he threw Maji to the ground and left, locking the door. 

Maji struggled for a while but managed to use the crates inside to get himself to his feet and hide behind a tall stack of them as he heard a pair of footsteps returning. Muffled voices he heard approach as the door unlocked and swung open again. "Where is he?" Said an unrecognised voice. "I left him right here, bound, unharmed like you asked." They proceeded to search the warehouse. Maji noticed them walk past the crates he was hiding among and saw a clear path to the door. And as he tried to make a run for it, he had forgotten momentarily that his legs were bound and fell straight to the ground. He got himself to his feet in the same manner again but the two figures found him. The same thuggish man who had brought him, and another finely dressed figure in red robes and a long beard. The thug grabbed him and thrust him in front of the other figure. The figure grabbed him by the face turning his head this way and that, studying him closely with dark piercing eyes. "Yes this is the one, knock him out and bring him". It was at this command that Maji felt a sudden surge of fear. 

A surge of fear, he felt adrenalin building in his veins expecting the blow to knock him out. But as the adrenalin built it surpassed the feeling of fear and he felt himself reverberate, the thug spun him around to face him "What the fuck is he doing?" He exclaimed as Maji saw the fear now in the thugs eyes. The other voice exclaimed "No. Not now. Not here. Quickly knock him out!" and as the figure said at last "Now!" Maji felt an almighty burst of energy. A blinding flash filled the room, a loud series of crashes he heard and then nothingness. Black.

Maji awoke once more, his binds were gone, there was crate debris everywhere and 2 bodies lay lifeless on the floor. In a panic, Maji ran for the still open door which now hung off it's hinges. Emerging from the warehouse he heard voices coming from beyond the gates he had entered through. Looking around he saw some exterior crates to his right and hid there as 2 more figures came through the gates and entered the warehouse. Maji did not stick around and fled through the gates as fast as he could, out into the strange streets of a city he didn't know. 

Later learned to indeed be Waterdeep, the city he and Terrence had set sail for, he first searched for knowledge, finding a bookshop or 2 dotted around the landscape. In the 2nd shop he entered, the shopkeep, an old woman with grey hair and a kind smile, noticed he was looking rough but could see he was not a ruffian. He took him in, offered him a warm bath and a meal, and answered his questions about the city. 

Still not quite taking in what had happened since he fled the University of Poppleferry, he had many questions this lady could not answer. Was Terrence okay? Who was the man in the red robes? Why did they want him? ...and what the fuck happened in the warehouse? 

Maji spent his next years as he grew from a teen to a young adult, learning what he could in Waterdeep. He took odd jobs, some plain and some using his knowledge and minor arcane skills, to earn the coin necessary to buy more books and glean more knowledge from the city Terrence told him was a font of great knowledge. But he never quite found anything to satisfy his thirst for rare findings. And nothing to explain what had happened to him on arrival in Waterdeep. He became bold and in search of rarer knowledge, turned to mercenary work and hung around taverns and places where he though he would be able to gain access to underground networks. 

It was in one such tavern, as he was having a drink and perusing the notice board, he was greeted by a tall tiefling with a stereotypical french accent and a way with words, and a strikingly similar name. He told him the Yawning Portal is the place to be for the good jobs, not this dive. So they made their way to the Yawning portal.
