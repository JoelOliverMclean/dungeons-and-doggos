## Class Progression

At Level 3, you get to **learn 2 more spells at 1st or 2nd Level** for free from the wizards spell list (below) to add to your spellbook.

You also gain **2 level 2 spell slots** and **1 additional level 1 spell slot**. So you now have **4 level 1 slots** and **2 level 2 slots**

You gain **1 extra prepared spell** (total of 6, this is your intelligence mod (3) + wizard level (3)). As a reminder, these can be prepared after a long rest and chosen from any of your known spells
