## Early Life

### What Maji doesn't know
Maji was born a gifted child, the 3 arcane professors who adopted him had been researching the anomaly and sought him out, made his mother an offer for a sizeable amount of money to take him away; she agreed, being in dire straits, also hoping for a better life for Maji that she could not provide. 

Maji's mum was a single mother, his father disappeared not long after she fell pregnant, leaving her to raise him alone. Little did she know he was watching from afar, knowing he was likely to be another gifted child. Like himself... He felt he was keeping his son safe by staying away as he felt he would draw unwanted attention when his son may not even be gifted. When he learned of his mother selling him to the three mages, he sought to track him down. But the professors had set up wards and protections at the university which prevented any kind of detection of intrusion of the child.  So when he escaped, his father was suddenly very aware of his presence. He hired mercenaries to help him retrieve his son. He was not afraid to be aggressive in his pursuit to keep his son safe. 

The 3 professors had followed research from scholars long since past who studied a rare and ancient primal magic which was said to reside within 1 child born every 2197 years (the number of times to moon orbits the earth cubed). Armed with this knowledge and following the signs and given the year they deduced that Maji was the first child in 2197 years to be born with this rare gift, and they intended to study him and hopefully harness the power for themselves, publishing all their findings in the hopes that they would become world renowned for their discovery, and maybe all powerful. 

They would test the boy with a series of aptitude tests, reaction tests and physical tests to try and gleam any information or sign they could that he was indeed a thing of rare magic. Their findings were inconclusive and they grew increasingly frustrated.
In their frustration they became distant from Maji, almost resentful that they had seemingly wasted their time.

### What Maji knows
The three arcane professors were burgeoning fellows of the School of the Arcane at the University of Poppleferry, an upper class city on a continent over the sea from Waterdeep.

He has fleeting memories of his parents, happy memories from being very young, but he didn't develop a full memory until he was already with the wizards where he was raised to believe they died in an accident and the professors adopted him from an orphanage. 

### The rest after what he doesn't know
It was at this time that Maji became curious about his parents, and found some books in the library on necromancy and the ability to bring beings back to life. He intended to try and raise the spirits of his parents, but first he had to practice. 

When he was younger, the university had a mascot, a mastiff by the name of Popple XII. He had played with him a fair few times and the two shared a bond. He had passed barely a year ago and Maji decided his first attempt would be to bring back Popple XII. This, while somewhat surprisingly successful, had unintended side-effects and repercussions, as the spirit of Popple XII that returned could not comprehend what was happening and lashed out in a blind panic, seeing Maji as a threat and started to attack out of instinct. 

Hearing the barking of the dog and the panicked screams of Maji, Terrence, an understudy to one of the 3 professors who Maji got on well with came into the room and managed to scare the dog away, who bolted straight for the door and ran through the halls. 

They studied a lot together and Terrence shared Maji's frustration with the professors, which led to them both deciding that for the betterment of their knowledge (and privately for Maji, the possibility of reviving his "dead" parents) they should run away and explore the world, gain knowledge beyond the books of the library of Poppleferry.

They took a series of carriages from town to town looking for the next big city with a source of knowledge they could draw from. Terrence had heard of Waterdeep and its vastness and thought it was the place to go. So they used almost all of their funds to board a ship over the sea to a new continent and the city of Waterdeep. 

Here they went in search of an institute of knowledge and study, but along the way they did not expect the city to be so unlike Poppleferry, the mix of classes and the rough nature of the streets at night took them aback. One thing led to another and they lost each other in the throws of the city. Maji, on his own, thought a good shout would be to find a library of university and wait there, thinking Terrence would follow the same logic. 

Maji found the Waterdeep Hall of Study and waited there for Terrence, reading books to pass the time, but he never arrived. With the sudden absence of his friend and the distancing professors over the years, Maji found himself yearning for family. He found himself needing to make money and thought he could use what he knew to do so. He struggled for a while, Waterdeep was rough and people were put off by his pomposity, but one day in the Yawning Portal he met a Tiefling with a stereotypical french accent and strangely similar name to himself.

## Thinking about the future
- The red hooded man is Maji's father, who hasn't tried to get to him again since because he is still watching him from afar and is somewhat afraid of his own son.
