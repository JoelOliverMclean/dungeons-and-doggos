## Class Progression

At Level 2, you get to **learn 2 more 1st Level spells** for free from the wizards spell list (below) to add to your spellbook.

> I recommend [5e Tools](https://5e.tools/spells.html) for looking them up, listing all definitions here would be madness

You also gain **1 extra prepared spell** (total  of 5, this is your intelligence mod (3) + wizard level (2))

## Feature Progression

### Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition from the list of available traditions, shaping your practice of magic. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. I recommend you read up on all of them before making your decision. Each tradition brings different benefits and additions to your character as you level up.
