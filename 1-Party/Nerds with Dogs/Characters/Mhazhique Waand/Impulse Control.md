- Player tracks character's **Stress Level** (stacks like Exhaustion, starts at 0, max 6)
- If the player or GM feels an action or effect warrants impulse control, player rolls a **DC 10 (+ 2x Stress)** Wisdom Save.
	- On a success, player acts or reacts however they desire, in character this should be less impulsive
	- On a failure, player takes **1 stress** and must act impulsively, they can decide how for themselves or ask the GM for suggestions.

# Stress Table
Once gained, all effects last until stress reduced to 0. If player reduces some but not all stress, they roll a **1d6 for each number of levels cleared** and remove any effects that match up on the stress table that the player has on them, if the matched effect isn't one that the player has then they **do not re-roll**.

| 1d6 | Effect                                                                |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Distracted - AC reduced by 2                                          |
| 2   | Headache - Proficiency Bonus reduced to 0                             |
| 3   | Pessimism - Critical Successes are just flat 20s                      |
| 4   | Dread - Always last in initiative order                               |
| 5   | Anxiety - Charisma bonus reduced to 0 and rolls made at disadvantage |
| 6   | Hesitancy - Hit bonus reduced by 2                                    |

## Clearing Stress
- With **1-3 levels** of stress, a long rest will remove all stress. On a short rest, PC can remove **1d3** (1d6 halved) levels of stress (meditation).
- With **4 levels** of stress, meditation drops to **1d2** (1d4 halved), and on a long rest player can remove **1d6** levels of stress.
- With **5 levels** of stress, meditation is no longer possible, on a long rest, player must succeed on a **DC 10** Wisdom check to remove **2 levels** of stress and restore hp, otherwise stay at 5 levels (stressful nightmares) and restoring half hp.
- With **6 levels** of stress, player cannot remove stress on their own and must seek magical help, long rests only restore 1/2 of the hp they usually do, player cannot use hit dice on a short rest. 
- If player has any effects from the stress table, roll 1d6 to remove an effect per stress level cleared. If rolled effect doesn't apply, no effect is cleared for that roll.
