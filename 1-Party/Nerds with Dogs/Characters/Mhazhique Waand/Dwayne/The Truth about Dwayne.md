Dwayne is not just a magical rock. The rock is just a part of Dwayne, and those in posession of the rest of Dwayne have discovered that it has disappeared from the basement of the warehouse they left it in. Dwayne is much more, and the percieved owners are looking for this piece.

# What is Dwayne
Dwayne is a young, special variety [[earth-elemental|Earth Elemental]], the result of experimentation by a wizard in the service of the [[1-monster-lore#The Xanathar Guild|The Xanathar Guild]] called [[narl-xibrindas-wdh|Nar'l Xibrindas]]. 

The piece of Dwayne that Mhazhique comes across is his core; it contains the main elements of the magic that Nar'l infused into the elemental he experimented on and thus the spirit which Mhazhique has experienced and bonded with. 

# The Loss of Dwayne
Mercenaries and groups of Xanathar Guild thugs will try and retrieve the core from Mhazhique either by force or sleight of hand until they succeed or until the party encounters Nar'l, if they figure out what's going on. 
If the party manages to take out any of the Xanathar thugs the party will be able to tell who they are via tattoos if they investigate the bodies.

If the party manages to interrogate one of the mercenaries they will give up information about who hired them and why for a price (they quote , 

# Recovering Dwayne
If the core is retrieved from Mhazhique by forces in league with Nar'l then to try and recover it they will need to find out where it's gone and who has it (Nar'l) and attempt recovery by some means they plan. 

Nar'l has a lab in Waterdeep's underground network which is controlled by the Xanathar Guild. 

If the party asks [[Vincent Trench]] for help, for a fee he will investigate. For 100 Gold he will find out who is behind it (The Xanathar Guild/Nar'l) for 250 gold he will find the location of it (Nar'l's Lab). After consulting Vincent Trench, if they choose not to, or can't afford to pay him, there is a chance that [[Trilbi the Magnificent]] will find/message Mhazhique and ask for the favour he promised. Retrieving something from Nar'l's lab, and as an incentive will inform him that something he has lost also lies there.
