## Backstory
When Mhazhique was just a boy of 7, his father’s Kingdom was at war with a foreign land. Facing certain and horrific defeat, he surrendered before all was lost. The king of this foreign land, [[Céret]], demanded a show of loyalty from his father, **(Papa, but replaced with name)**, a tribute to spare what remained of his kingdom. Papa proposed he send his most precious commodity; his own son, eldest son and heir, to be raised in [[Céret]]’s kingdom, and to wed his daughter when the boy came of age. [[Céret]] accepted this idea, a deal was struck and Mhazhique was sent to be raised in his kingdom. 

As time passed, Mhazhique turned 13 and the day of the wedding arrived. Seated in the halls of [[Céret]]’s fortress, the procession went as planned, that was until both bride and groom got to the altar. Before the officiant could speak, [[Céret]] announced he would like to say a few words. His guards swiftly moved to block all exits and at his command, all of Mhazhique’s family present were restrained by guards seated behind them. They were moved to the front and placed on their knees in a row, before [[Céret]] began his speech. 

He expressed his displeasure at a few many things; the way Papa just thought all was solved by sending him his son, that he had not received any tribute over the years, nor recognition for the “honour” of marrying into his family. But most notably he called into question the worthiness of Mhazhique to wed his daughter. He labelled all Mhazhique’s family as traitors to his rule, took up his ceremonial sword, and one by one cut the throats of Mhazhique’s family. Turning to Mhazhique who himself was now restrained by a guard that was being hammered upon by his wife-to-be who was also screaming and in floods of tears, he spoke directly to him, softly, telling him how he has grown to pity him, to have such a family, and treasonous blood flowing through his veins. He commanded the guard to throw him in a cell. 

A few days passed, Mhazhique had not slept a wink, when he heard footsteps, but not the usual armoured footsteps of the guard, these were much quieter, and there were 2 sets. Appearing at the bars first was his sister, who with a furious look on her face was followed by his wife-to-be, looking much more panicky. His sister had not attended the wedding as she never agreed with the deal their father struck to send him away; they had been close growing up.

His sister and wife-to-be freed him from the prison cell and helped him escape the fortress. Climbing down the walls to open hills, edge of the forest in sight, Mhazhique was the first to hit the floor, but as he turned to watch his sister and wife-to-be descend after him, he saw from the top of the wall, and armoured arm grab his wife and sister and pull them back from the wall, but not before they heard their screams to “RUN MHAZHIQUE, RUN”

As archers appeared at the walls, Mhazhique fled towards the forest, zig zagging to avoid the arrows that flew over his head and by his side. He reached the forest but kept on running, his grief at watching his family slaughtered still raw, the thought of his sister and wife being captured and god knows what else even more so. Tears flooded his face as he ran, but as he got further and further into the forest, the tears dried and made way for fury. In his mind’s eye he saw only [[Céret]] and his desire to see him pay for what he’d done. 

He travelled to nearby lands, seeking help and knowledge when but a few days later, in a quiet moment in another forest, a higher power came to him to offer him patronage to help him enact fiery revenge on [[Céret]]. The being promised him great powers in exchange for his soul upon his death and to answer when called; in his blind desire he accepted “[[Ignaroch]]” as his patron.

Bestowed with new arcane power, Mhazhique gained entry to the halls he once called home to confront [[Céret]]. He used the path with which he originally escaped, and found [[Céret]] in the very hall he was due to be wed, the floor still awash with his family's blood. He was sat on a throne at the end of the hall, his wife-to-be beside him, and his sister in stocks in front of them. 

Storming up the aisle towards him, [[Céret]] rose from his chair pushing his wife-to-be and his sister aside, drawing his sword once more, as Mhazhique took from a pocket in his garments, a smooth rock, inscribed in it an infernal rune. Acting upon his new patrons instruction he took the rune in his hand, spoke the infernal incantation, translated roughly to mean "fire is the fury, burn for eternity".

Flames burst forth from the rune and engulfed [[Céret]] in a gigantic ball of fire and smoke, he screamed and flailed trying to help himself but the flames burned hotter than normal flame and his guards simply fled at the sight they did behold. Mhazhique, enshrouded in a shadow larger than he, held the rune forth, flames pouring ever still unto [[Céret]]. In the rage and fury he almost didn’t hear his wife-to-be screaming his name, but he did turn to see her at the door, beckoning him to her and screaming his name again and again. 

Mhazhique turned to run towards her, putting away the now a smooth rune-less stone, and they both ran the path once more to the wall. He gestured for her to go first, that he must find his sister and that she must flee. But she insisted she could not leave. She must stay and deal with the aftermath, but having been seen by the guards, he could not stay. She promised him she would find him again, and free his sister. But that he must run and stay away until he heard word from her.

He did as she said, for he trusted her, despite her father’s brutal murder of his family. They had grown close and their proposal was not just a deal for them. But as he went day-to-day in a nearby settlement, he heard murmurings. Locals spoke of an attempt to kill the king. Conflicting rumours spread that he still lived, and suddenly Mhazhique felt a mixture of frustration and fear. 

He made for the forest where he made a deal with his patron, and called for them. But they did not answer. He screamed until his lungs gave out but again, they did not answer. Not knowing what now to do, being so close, if the king were alive he could send guards to find him. He had to flee further. 

He fled from city to city, eventually landing in Waterdeep. From that fateful day, Mhazhique was filled with a bubbling frustration and fear born of paranoia. No official news of the king’s death ever reached his ears. He became quick to anger and quick to violence. To cope with the paranoia and fear, he changed his appearance, his demeanour, and went by the name Mhazhique, for it was one native to the lands of [[Céret]]; were he ever to be questioned by someone from there, he felt it would curry favour and to help keep his cover.

Despite the unanswered calls to his patron, Mhazhique learned over time that he had developed some arcane powers from his deal, that he would slowly hone over the years, doing mercenary work and minor criminal activity, all the while still waiting for word from his wife-to-be or his sister. And it was one such adventure which led him to meet his compatriots-to-be in a tavern called the Yawning Portal.
