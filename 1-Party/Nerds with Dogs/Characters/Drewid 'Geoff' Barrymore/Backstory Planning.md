#### Family
Family life was pleasant for Geoff, they hung out with their siblings and cousins a lot growing up, getting lost in the trees of the Thistlewood and fishing by the River Thistle. Her parents were humble folk, her father was a Baker and her mother was a seamstress. 

Growing up as Drewid Barrymore, she got the nickname Geoff from her Cousin Derrin, derived from a colloquial term "geoffing around", referring to her frequent visits to "geoff" (playing with reckless abandon) around in the woods.  

#### Life Changing Event
One day when playing in the Thistlewood, they were practising their tracking skills, when Geoff tried to track down her favourite Cousin Derrin, with whom she spent the most time. She followed the signs as they'd learned, displaced dirt, scent, disturbed flora; when she noticed signs of a skirmish. There were drag marks in parallel leading out of the other side of the Thistlewood and at the clearing beyond the trees she noticed cart tracks and hoof prints. Her cousin had been taken.

Back at the village, Geoff rushed to tell her parents, and the village seemed to be in disarray, a number of them had seemingly disappeared and could not be found. When Geoff told them of the cart tracks, her ideas were initially dismissed as fantastical and that they were just lost and would turn up or would be found. However her fellow cousins believed her and followed her to the site of the tracks. They came back and pleaded with the village alderman to take it seriously but they were still dismissed as dubious. But her parents believed her too now. 

Frustrated with the village leaders, Geoff decided to pack a bag and set out searching for Derrin, and thus began her ventures in the wide world. It was on her travels that she fostered her connection with nature, trying to further understand the way the natural world worked to help her find her cousin, learning druidic ways that she had first heard of from the village healer.
