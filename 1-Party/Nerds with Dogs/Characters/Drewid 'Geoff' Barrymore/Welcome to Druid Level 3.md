Roll **1d10 + CON (minimum of 1)** for HP boost or flat **5**

## Class Progression
At level 3 you gain **1 additional 1st level spell slot** and **2 2nd level spell slots**.

You also gain an extra prepared spell, you now have **5** (this is your **wisdom modifier** (2) + **druid level** (3) ). These can be changed when you level and after any long rest. These spells can be chosen from the following lists, any that have **Druid** and/or **Circle of the Moon** in the subclasses column.
