## Backstory
Gil Lioth hails from a whimsical Gnomish burrow called Merribore Hollow, some ways east of Waterdeep. He comes from a humble background; his father was a Tinkerer, though his mother sadly died from illness when he was just a wee babe. 

Growing up as an only child, he would watch his father tinker away, night and day, fascinated by the things he would create, both beautiful and functional. But as Gil grew, he became quite heavy handed for a Gnome and built a little thicker set than most of the rest of the population of Merribore Hollow. As a result, his many attempts to learn from his father fell short as tinkering didn't seem to come very naturally to him. 

As a young teenage Gnome, still looking for his place in the burrow and the wide world beyond, a group of bandits managed to slip past the burrows defence (a series of illusions designed to mislead, confuse and bewilder would-be intruders). However, Gil, almost instinctively, helped fend of the bandits using his heavy-set nature and found an aptitude for it. He decided to train in combat to help defend the burrow in the future should the illusions fail again. 

He would train every day, punching trees until his father, weary of picking out his splinters and wrapping his hands in linen to heal, built him some packed straw and clay dummies to use. And one day, happy that his son finally found a path to follow, took to his workshop to build his son a fantastical looking Warhammer. Glistening gems inlaid, Gil's father told him the Warhammer was infused with magic, stored in gems once owned by his mother, which now lay in the handle of his Warhammer. He told him they would protect him from harm, but that he must train hard. 

Upon reaching adulthood, the burrow had remained un-attacked, and Gil grew restless. He asked his father if he could leave the burrow in search of a nearby mercenary guild he had heard of from a travelling merchant. Gil's father, though reluctant, had also grown sad seeing his son become listless so soon after finding a calling in life. He agreed, though he made Gil promise to uphold the family morals, and keep his mother in mind when it came to the kind of jobs he would accept. Gil agreed to the terms of course. 

Gil set out from the burrow heading North in search of a mercenary guild that the merchant said was situated in a mostly human settlement called Kevinstone. He reached the small town and after a few questions, quite easily found directions to the mercenaries guild there which was situated on the edge of town to the west in an old watchtower. 

Gil entered and signed up, the clerk taking one look at his heavy set nature and gleaming Warhammer didn't question his aptitude for even a second. He was shown the mess hall and the job board and told how to take jobs and gather a group to take on bigger jobs. And it wasn't long before Gil took his first job. This went on for a little over 2 years, and after many jobs, one job would change Gil's life forever.

He had gathered a regular party of mercenaries, who would take on jobs together and this had been going on for just over a year when they took a job to help a farmer deal with his livestock being mysteriously killed when they ventured close to the forest bordering his land. 

Upon investigating they found a corrupted Treefolk, his bark seemed to be leaking thick black tar, and he wildly attacked any living thing that came near the forest. And during the fight, the party was looking rough, the Treefolk was hardy. Gil went for a swing, hoping to land the killing blow and get the plaudits, but the Treefolk grabbed the head of his Warhammer and pressed it back against Gil's chest and kept pushing. The rest of the party unloaded on the tree, wailing on him to get him away but the Treefolk kept pushing the head of the warhammer into his chest.

Gil could feel his strength failing, his grip on the handle slipping. He could feel it tearing into his chest when all of a sudden he felt a blast of energy, there was a blinding white light, and everything went dark.

Gil awoke some time later, feeling at his chest for the warhammer finding only a healed over scar. He looked around and found himself at the centre of a small crater. The treefolk lay dead, arm once pressing the warhammer into his chest now shattered and scattered across the ground. But his was not the only body. The bodies of all Gil's fellow mercenaries lay dead in an outward pattern away from the centre of the crater. 

Distraught at the loss of his friends, Gil headed home to his father with haste and told him what happened. Confused and in disarray with what happened, his father sat him down and made him a cup of tea and said he had something to tell him. 

The warhammer he made him was not infused with magic at all, and it was not the warhammer which caused the event. Gil's father told him of his bloodline on his mother's side. And explained to him the reason for his mother's illness from which she passed. 

Her bloodline, which passed onto Gil, was one that was closely connected to the strand of ether which connects the physical world to the magical world. A connection that few have ever managed to control. In many of their kin, the connection never surfaced and they lived normal lives. In others it manifested in different ways. With Gil's mother, the connected manifested as a resonance with the natural world, and the pain of bringing Gil into the world had caused her to channel the resonance with devastating consequences for her own health. The connection had tried to fight the internal systems which restore the body after birth, which not only made the birth more painful than a normal Gnomish birth, but it also caused her to get very ill afterwards, eventually succumbing to a virus like infection that took over her immune system which ultimately led to her passing. A most tragic and not-before-seen consequence of this connection. 

Learning the truth of his mother, this connection and that ultimately his friends death was due to his bloodline, he ran far, far as he could before his feet could no longer carry him, and found himself in a strange town where he dwelled for a while, living off what he had left from his mercenary work. Though overtime his confusion only grew as he refused to accept his nature and the truth his father spoke to him. The confusion began manifested itself in an uncontrollable rage...

He would go on to be barred from every tavern in town, for bar brawls which he never remembered as he started to drink to quell the rage and confusion. He found his way back to Kevinstone and the mercenary guild where he began to take on work again, but this time he took on anything and everything he could just to distract himself, and of course, drinking whenever he could. It was in this stint of mercenary work that he met Yagra and joined her band of mercenaries, but he kept his distance, not getting attached and not getting close. Though he gained a respect amongst the mercenaries as a Gnome who got the job done with ruthless efficiency. 

He learned to use the rage to his advantage in his work, continuing to drink copious amounts of Ale to quell the rage in his downtime. But once the rage took hold he could not quell it by choice. He found himself in almost fugue-like states when it did. 

That was until he met Flick. After leaving Yagra's company, finding himself becoming too close and too attached, he wandered alone for a while, taking on solo work. But one day he found himself doing a job with a band of random mercenaries who did not know each other, one of which was Flick.

Flick was at first annoyingly friendly, pestering Gil with his friendship. Gil shrugged it off until one day he found himself in a dire situation. He was out of Ale, and he could feel the rage coming on. Not wanting to cause a scene he started to panic. Flick recognised this immediately and started to sing a song. And in this moment Gils rage began to subside. Something about the song or the way it was sung, seemed to resonate with the rage inside Gil, tempering it to a controllable level. And from that day forth they adventured together, always. Taking merc work together and travelling as companions.

However, fearing a lapse, Gil never strayed from the Ale, thinking that all this time, it was the only thing that had prevented another event like the one with the Treefolk.
