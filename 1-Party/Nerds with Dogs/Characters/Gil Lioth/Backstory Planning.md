#### Key Points
- Tie subclassing as Path of Wild Magic into Gil's past. Perhaps his drinking and rage were born of an accident that happened as a result of a wild magic surge.
- Knows Yagra from mercenary work in the past before meeting Flick
- Met Flick a while before the campaign started too (Flick learned how to calm Gil's rage, a song which happens to resonate with Gil's Inner Wild Magic)

#### Background
- From a burrow known as Merribore Hollow
- Father was a tinkerer, his mother died when he was young
- Grew up an only child watching his father tinker 
- For a gnome he was quite heavy handed, a bit thicker set than most Gnomes from the burrow, which meant his many attempts to learn from his Father, tinkering didn't come naturally to him.
- One day a group of bandits managed to slip past the burrows illusions, but Gil helped to fend them off, finding his heavy handed nature to be of much use to that end. 
- He decided to train in combat, and his father who was thrilled that Gil had found a path to follow, tinkered for a while and crafted him a magically infused Warhammer
- Gil would train with the Warhammer everyday, growing stronger, and upon reaching young adulthood, applied to a mercenaries guild nearby, after promising his father he would only take moral jobs and not sully the name of Lioth. 
- One day, on an early mission in Gil's mercenary career, he came face to face with a vast hulking corrupted Treefolk. The angry Treefolk caught Gil's warhammer in a swing towards him and thrust it back toward Gil, deep into his chest, and the warhammer crumbled under the force, next thing Gil knew there was an almighty blast that emanated from where the hammer met his chest and suddenly everything went dark for Gil.
- He awoke with a pounding headache and a pain in his chest. The pieces of the warhammer lay scattered across his chest and around his body on the ground as he looked around and saw 6 bodies lying on the ground some feet away from him, the Treefolk included. 
- They were all dead. Gil grasped at his chest to check his wound and saw that it had scarred over already. The Treefolk lay on it's back with is arm blown to smithereens some feet away from it's body. The remaining 5 bodies belonged to his fellow mercenaries, with whom he'd come to form a strong bond. They were all standing at the time everything went dark.
- Gil returned to his father, told him what happened. His father explained that there was no magic infused in the warhammer. It was inert, as were the inlaid gems. He took Gil aside to explain to him his bloodline. That every so often in the Lioth bloodline of Gnomes, a child is born with an intimate connection to the strand of aether that connects the magical world to the physical. Gil, confused, angry, upset at the loss of his friends and being told by his father that it was infact him and his blood that caused a surge of magical force that killed his fellow mercs, his friends. 
- He ran from his father and never stopped. He never again experienced the effect. And the frustration only built as his confusion grew, and it manifested in Gil as an often uncontrollable rage which came out in battle or conflict more often than not. 
- He took merc work back up, It was during this time that he met Yagra and joined her company. 
- He would use his rage to his advantage, and drink copious amounts of Ale in his downtime to quell the rage when it wasn't needed. But he could never quell the rage once it took hold. He was almost in a fugue-state until it faded.
- That was at least until he met Flick. Both doing mercenary work to make ends meet.
- Flick learned that a song he remembered from when he was young, helped to calm Gil's rages. Little did he know, the resonant frequencies of the song were in touch with the nature of Gil's Wild Magic, helping to subdue the rage. The wild magic however, never came to the fore, because once no longer raging, Gil turned straight to the ale, which quelled not only the rages, but also the wild magic. 
- However, the more Gil drank, the more tolerance he built up. Upon reaching level 3, Gil had built up such a tolerance, that it no longer subdued his wild magic surges as they resurfaced.
