## Backstory
[[Flick McPlumbs]], formerly **Fondel Mighnuts** a.k.a. "**Fondy**", came from a family of famous travelling bards known as [[The Mighnuts]]. They played far and wide, never settling in a single location, earning plenty of coin. 

As he got older, his parents [[Diddelus 'Diddel' Mighnuts]] and [[Fedalia 'Fiddle' Mighnuts]] wanted him to play a wind instrument, as it would best compliment the band's existing sound (the "sound" was everything). 

However Flick had other musical aspirations, he had his eyes set on a [[Magical Harpsichord]] he had seen in a shop window in a small town (**insert name here**) they had passed through going from city to city. His parents refused as they weren't "that kind of band" and it didn't "fit the vibe". 

This refusal to let him follow his desires, coupled with their general lack of affection behind closed doors (only played "lovable family" for the audience, typical stage family), Flick ran away at the next opportunity into some nearby woods, jumping from his parents wagon, he did not know if they gave chase, but they never caught him if they did (he doesn't believe they did). 

Later that evening, Flick was sitting against a tree, comforting himself by singing some of his favourite songs and pretending to play the harpsichord, when he heard a rustle and turned around to see a curious looking being.

Stood sheepishly among the trees and shrubbery, almost shy, was a young female half-orc. She waved and he waved back. He learned her name was [[Thura]] and she lived not far from here with her tribe of half-orcs. He learned that she was attracted to the sound of his singing as it sounded much like the blood curdling cries of battle (he wasn't much of a singer in truth). He explained to [[Thura]] that he was abandoned and looking for somewhere to go and a purpose to fulfil. She invited him back to her tribe, who were more accepting of humans than most orcish tribes as they had struck a trade bargain with a nearby human settlement. 

Flick went back with [[Thura]], met her family and her wider tribe, and they took him in like one of their own. They did not have much by way of bardic tradition but they did teach him their ways of the warrior, and Flick soon became a capable warrior. As the years went by Flick and [[Thura]] got on like a house on fire. Almost brother and sister they were, tormenting each other just as much as they would help each other out. Outside of their friendship, he even became somewhat of an ambassador for the half-orcs in the settlement they had a deal with, convincing some of the more sceptical humans that the half-orcs were good.

One day, in the settlement, as Flick and [[Thura]] arrived, he spotted a familiar looking wagon. Dressed in the colours of his family, and from within a nearby tavern he could hear the lute picking of his father and the fiddle of his mother (he was named after her favourite instrument, yet he was always second fiddle to the real thing). He burst into the tavern, [[Thura]] in tow, and confronted his parents.

They immediately rose to anger in response, showed no sign of remorse and questioned how he dare leave them without a roadie for so long, having to lug their own instruments (a job he was saddled with previously) from gig to gig, and making them look bad. They used their bardic experience to rally the crowd, and seeing [[Thura]] by Flick's side, they saw an opportunity and immediately blamed her. They made claims that a local tribe of vicious orcs stole their son from them, how he was brainwashed by their shaman and made to mate with one of them. Flick and Thura looked confused as they pointed her out and after stirring up an awful racket, incited an attack on [[Thura]] and on the tribe. 

Flick and [[Thura]] fled immediately from the village and made for the forest, back to the tribe to warn them. Flick knew of his family's potential for influence and feared the worst. They made it back to the tribe and told them everything, but before they could even prepare a defence, the warm glow of torch fire grew from the distance as the shouting got louder and louder. 

Seeing nothing but a bad end to the half-orcs if they stayed to fight, Flick called upon some of the influential powers he learned from his parents, convinced them to flee, that it was him they wanted and they would leave them alone if they got him back. Teary eyed but swayed by his influence, [[Thura]] and her family ran in the opposite direction. Some half-orcs grabbed what supplies they could and followed. Flick stayed behind in the camp and soon the riotous gang arrived.

It seemed as though everyone from the town was there; man, woman and child. He pled with them to go back, that he would return with them, and the half-orcs would be no trouble. But they did not listen. His parents' influence was too great. They burst past him, barely acknowledging him not his plea, and began to torch and break everything in the camp. Flick was speechless, spinning, seeing the flames rise and the community he had known for the past year be destroyed as he looked towards the direction in which his new family had fled. He took a deep breath, and made a dash, but as he did he felt a grip on his arm. His father pulled him back and dragged him back to the town. 

Flick was locked in the wagon, as his parents got their stuff together and made to leave. They did not speak another word to him until they reached the next town/city. They did not even give him a place in the band back immediately. He was solely a roadie for a while. Depressed and defeated, Flick accepted this for a while. Until one day, while he was packing up the wagon, he overheard his parents talking about [[Thura]] and the half-orcs. 

Oh how they slandered them, the things they said about them that were simply not true and how they laughed about what they did, how they made an entire town rise up and drive out an entire tribe of half-orcs. Flick snapped. He burst into a torrent of angry shouting aimed at his parents, he busted his mother's fiddle over his knee shouting "Who's second fiddle now mother?!" and vowed if he ever saw them again, he would torch them like they torched his real family. And he fled once more. And once more, he did not believe they pursued.

He changed his name to [[Flick McPlumbs]] and took to the shadows. Going from town to city, he became embroiled in petty thievery and mercenary work using the fighting skills he learned from the half-orcs, to make coin and survive. He got in with some gangs but didn't stick around for long at a time. At least until he got involved with a gang of mischievous thieves who sought to benefit the poor by stealing from and pranking the rich. A gang populated with many races, including half-orcs. Flick began to soften, his outlook became more positive, and he saw a way out of this life. 

He made it his mission to do more for half-orc relations like he had with his tribe (he called them his tribe) and helped out half-orcs whenever he could. He put his talents to good use, helping farmers with troublesome pests and other odd jobs. 

He sometimes dreams of what life would be like if he were to return to the world of music, he still dreams of that [[Magical Harpsichord]]... It was one of these positive missions however, that led him to meet [[Gil Lioth]] and learned about his life and how to calm him down when he got into a rage, by singing a little song, perhaps of his own making, perhaps from his childhood. And as they found themselves in Waterdeep one fateful day, sat around a table in [[The Yawning Portal]], that is where his adventure began for real.
