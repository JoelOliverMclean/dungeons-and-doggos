## Description
The Sleeping Snake is a notorious and shadowy inn located in the heart of Waterdeep’s Dock Ward. Known for its seedy clientele and the intimidating presence of its boar-kin innkeeper, Borrick, this inn is a haven for smugglers, thieves, and other underworld figures. Here’s a detailed description of The Sleeping Snake and its sinister innkeeper:

### Exterior and Location

- **Building:** The Sleeping Snake is housed in a decrepit stone and timber building that leans precariously to one side. The exterior is covered in grime, with cracked windows and faded paint giving it an aura of neglect and danger. It is tucked away in a narrow, dark alley, making it easy to miss unless you know where to look.
- **Signage:** A creaking wooden sign hangs above the entrance, depicting a coiled, menacing snake with glowing red eyes. The words “The Sleeping Snake” are scrawled beneath in chipped, faded letters.

### Interior and Atmosphere

- **Entrance Hall:** Entering the inn, patrons are immediately struck by the dim lighting and the smell of stale ale and smoke. The walls are dark and grimy, covered in layers of soot and filth. The floorboards creak ominously with every step.
- **Common Room:** The main room is shrouded in shadows, with only a few flickering lanterns providing meager illumination. The tables and chairs are mismatched and rickety, many with scars from old brawls and knife fights. A few rough-looking patrons hunch over their drinks, casting wary glances at newcomers.
- **Lighting:** The inn is poorly lit, with the few lanterns casting long, eerie shadows. The overall effect is one of gloom and secrecy, perfect for those looking to conduct illicit business away from prying eyes.

### Notable Features

- **The Bar:** The bar is a scarred and battered counter made of rough-hewn wood, sticky with spilled drinks and other, less identifiable substances. Behind the bar, shelves are sparsely stocked with cheap, strong liquors and a few dubious-looking bottles.
- **Seating Areas:** The seating is haphazard, with wobbly tables and uncomfortable chairs. A few darkened corners provide some semblance of privacy for shady deals and whispered conversations.
- **Decorations:** The inn is decorated with a motley assortment of stolen goods, ranging from tarnished silverware to exotic animal pelts. A large, cracked mirror behind the bar reflects the dim light and adds to the inn’s eerie ambiance.

### The Innkeeper: Borrick

- **Appearance:** Borrick is a hulking boar-kin with a fearsome presence. His face is a blend of human and boar features, with a prominent snout, sharp tusks, and small, cunning eyes. His body is covered in coarse, bristly hair, and he wears grimy, tattered clothing that looks more suited to a brigand than an innkeeper.
- **Personality:** Borrick is gruff and intimidating, with little patience for nonsense. He runs The Sleeping Snake with an iron fist, ensuring that troublemakers are swiftly dealt with. Despite his rough exterior, he is shrewd and cunning, always aware of the goings-on in his establishment.
- **Background:** Little is known about Borrick’s past, but rumors abound that he was once a pirate or a bandit. His knowledge of the underworld and his connections to various criminal elements make him a valuable ally—or a dangerous enemy.

### Specialties and Events

- **Signature Drinks:** The Sleeping Snake offers a selection of cheap, potent brews that cater to its rough clientele. The most infamous is “Serpent’s Venom,” a harsh, burning liquor that is said to have a bite as bad as its namesake.
- **Food:** The menu is limited and unappetizing, featuring greasy stews, stale bread, and mystery meat pies. Most patrons come for the drink, not the food.
- **Entertainment:** The inn occasionally hosts underground fights and illegal gambling, drawing a crowd of unsavory characters. Borrick keeps a tight grip on these activities, ensuring that they remain profitable and under control.

### Reputation

- **Underworld Hub:** The Sleeping Snake is well-known among Waterdeep’s criminal elements as a place to find work, fence stolen goods, or hide from the law. Its reputation as a dangerous and lawless establishment keeps away most honest folk.
- **Dangerous Haven:** While the inn is a haven for criminals, it is also a dangerous place. Brawls and knife fights are common, and it’s not unusual for patrons to disappear without a trace. However, those who can handle themselves—or who have Borrick’s favor—find it a valuable refuge.

### Ambiance

- **Dark and Foreboding:** The inn’s dim lighting and shadowy corners create an atmosphere of fear and suspicion. The constant threat of violence hangs in the air, making it clear that this is not a place for the faint of heart.
- **Seedy and Mysterious:** The eclectic mix of stolen goods and Borrick’s enigmatic presence add an air of mystery to the inn. Patrons often find themselves drawn into secretive deals and dangerous schemes.

In summary, The Sleeping Snake is a shadowy and notorious inn in Waterdeep’s Dock Ward, known for its dangerous clientele and the intimidating presence of its boar-kin innkeeper, Borrick. Its dark, foreboding atmosphere and reputation as an underworld hub make it a favored spot for criminals and those seeking to avoid the law.
