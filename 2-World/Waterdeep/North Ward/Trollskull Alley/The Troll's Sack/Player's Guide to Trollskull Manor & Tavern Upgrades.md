# Upgrade Options for Trollskull Manor

Waterdeep: Dragon Heist rewards players with the deed to [[The Troll's Sack]] a run-down former mansion/tavern. With enough gold, the party can make basic renovations and set themselves up to re-open the tavern. With a little more gold, they can make the place shine.

## Tavern Upgrades

Basic renovations include a basic-level kitchen, cellar, taproom with hearth, and larder–everything you need to get started.

However, these are the bare minimum, leaving your tavern in Squalid condition. Most tavern upgrades grant an increase in your tavern's valuation. Valuation levels then determine the base cost (and revenue!) of the tavern, as well as the kind of patrons to expect. See page 4 (Calculating Revenue) for a description of how to use valuation and expected costs.

| Valuation | Tavern Quality | Expected Cost Per Tenday |
| :-------: | :------------: | :----------------------: |

# Calculating Revenue for Your Tavern

The following is a formula for calculating revenue that reflects more realistic profit margins of a tavern that is operating with a full staff in a mortgaged or rented property. This is a guide that the DM can adjust as appropriate for the individual circumstances of the tavern in question.

Once a tenday, the party should **roll 2d20 - 10** to determine the **profit percentage** (range -8% to +30%).

To calculate profits earned, multiply the percentage by the cost found on the chart below.

| Valuation | Tavern Quality | Expected Cost Per Tenday |
| :-------: | :------------: | :----------------------: |
|    1-5    |    Squalid     |          45 gp           |
|   6-12    |      Poor      |          60 gp           |
|   13-19   |     Modest     |          75 gp           |
|   20-30   |  Comfortable   |          95 gp           |
|   31-44   |    Upscale     |          125 gp          |
|    45+    |  Aristocratic  |          160 gp          |

#### Additional Factors

As stated above, the baseline formula presented above is for a tavern with a fully paid, fully staffed tavern paying rent. The following common factors will adjust the formula:

- Without rent or a mortgage, raise the **profit percentage** by 8% (**i.e., roll 2d20 - 2**).
- Costs include N workers, where N = Expected Cost / 10 (round up). Non-living staff can count as 2 workers.
- If any staff are unpaid, add 3 gp per tenday to the profit.
- If any paid staff are paid in part with room and board, add 1 gp per tenday to the profit.
- If the tavern has any of the applicable upgrades that increase revenue (upgraded cobble streets, luxury beer engine, luxury cellar, luxury hearth, luxury kitchen, luxury larder, luxury taproom), remember to add the appropriate amount to the final profit.
- If one or more characters spend a full Downtime managing tavern operations, they may add 1d4 to the profit percentage roll.

#### Example Calculation

The Adventurers Five run a tavern of with valuation 34 (Upscale). The weekly expected of an upscale tavern is 125 gp, but they own the property, the bartender is a poltergeist, and 9 of their 11 living employees live onsite. They have upgraded cobbled streets and a luxury taproom.

At the end of the first tenday, the party rolls an 18 on their 2d20, their profit percentage would normally 8%. However, since they own the property, their profit percentage roll is **2d20 - 2**, leaving them with a 16% profit percentage.

16% of 125 gp is 20 gp, which is the tavern's base profit for the tenday. However, they are saving 12 gp per tenday on staff and earn 11 gp from their upgrades.

20 gp (base) + 12 gp (staff) + 11 gp (upgrades) = 43 gp

The Adventurers Five takes **43 gp** in profits for the tenday.

### Tavern Events

_Durnan's Guide to Tavernkeeping_ has a delightful table of Tavern Events the DM can throw at the tavern owners in the event that they are not present for the nightly operations of the tavern. If you use that table, make the following edits:

- For events that deduct or add to the business results roll, reduce by a factor of 10 and deduct/add to the percentage profit roll. For example, instead of a +20 bonus on the business results table, give a +2 bonus to the percentage profit roll (2d20 - 8 instead of 2d20 - 10) .
- For events that give a straight award or cost in gold, reduce by a factor of ten (i.e. "1d6 x 10 gp" becomes "1d6 gp" and "8d8
  gp" becomes "8d8 sp") .

### Tavern Bills

Unless characters are dealing with day-to-day running of the tavern, prices of individual tabs should not come up regularly. However, keep in mind the daily cost of living for each lifestyle level associated with the tavern's quality. The below chart reflects the full cost per day, the average cost of a larger meal, and the average cost of a night of lodging (or an extravagent meal with many rounds of alcohol, a la the Carousing Downtime activity).

| Tavern Quality | Full Day Expenses | Large Meal | Lodging or Carousing |
| :------------: | :---------------: | :--------: | :------------------: |
|    Squalid     |       1 sp        |    1 cp    |         5 cp         |
|      Poor      |       2 sp        |    2 cp    |         1 sp         |
|     Modest     |       1 gp        |    1 sp    |         5 sp         |
|  Comfortable   |       2 gp        |    2 sp    |         1 gp         |
|    Upscale     |       4 gp        |    4 sp    |         2 gp         |
|  Aristocratic  |       10 gp       |    1 gp    |         5 gp         |
