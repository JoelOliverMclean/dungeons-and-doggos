> [!summary] Description
> Located on the edge of [[Trollskull Alley]] this small tavern is an eyesore. Serving only [[Emmek Frewn]]'s very own craft creation, the tavern namesake, Frewn's Brew. A thick, strong black ale. The tavern is quite the hot spot for drunken wanderers who manage to stumble their way into the [[North Ward]]
