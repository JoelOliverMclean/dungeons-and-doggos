## Description
The Angry Coxswain is a notorious dive bar located in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep, a bustling city known for its diverse population and vibrant, albeit sometimes dangerous, nightlife. Here are some details to paint a picture of The Angry Coxswain:

### Appearance and Atmosphere

- **Exterior:** The bar has a weathered, salt-stained exterior that blends in with the other dilapidated buildings in the Dock Ward. A faded sign depicting a furious coxswain (the person who steers a rowing boat) adorns the entrance, swinging creakily in the sea breeze.
- **Interior:** Inside, the bar is dimly lit, with flickering oil lamps casting shadows across the rough wooden tables and the uneven floorboards. The smell of stale ale and brine permeates the air. Nautical decor, including fishing nets, ship wheels, and various maritime artifacts, are scattered haphazardly around the room.
- **Clientele:** The patrons are a rough-and-tumble mix of sailors, dockworkers, and adventurers. It's a place where one might hear tales of sea monsters, pirate treasure, and other seafaring legends. The bar is also a known haunt for smugglers and those looking to hire (or avoid) mercenaries.

### Notable Features

- **The Bar:** The bar itself is a long, scarred wooden counter behind which the bartender, a grizzled old sailor named Kellan “Saltbeard” Moray, holds court. Saltbeard is missing an eye and several fingers, souvenirs from his years at sea. Despite his gruff demeanor, he is a wealth of information and has connections throughout the Dock Ward.
- **Entertainment:** On some nights, the bar hosts impromptu shanty singing contests or arm-wrestling matches. A small stage in one corner is occasionally used by bards or local performers.
- **The Back Room:** A more private area in the back is often used for discreet meetings or shady deals. It's not uncommon for mercenaries to be hired or contraband to change hands in this part of the bar.

### Reputation

- **Infamous Incidents:** The Angry Coxswain has a reputation for brawls and violent altercations. It's said that if you can drink there without getting into a fight, you must have the luck of Tymora herself.
- **Connections:** Due to its location and clientele, the bar is a good place to pick up rumors about the goings-on in Waterdeep, particularly concerning the underworld and maritime affairs. It's rumored that members of the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim frequent the place.

### Specialties

- **Signature Drink:** The bar is known for its "Salted Kraken Ale," a potent brew with a briny taste that only the hardiest sailors can stomach. Another specialty is the "Coxswain's Grog," a mix of rum, lime, and secret spices.
- **Food:** The food is basic but hearty, often consisting of chowders, stews, and hardtack. Fresh seafood is sometimes available, depending on the catch of the day.

In summary, The Angry Coxswain is a gritty, atmospheric dive bar that serves as a meeting place for Waterdeep's more unsavory characters, providing a perfect backdrop for adventures and intrigue.
