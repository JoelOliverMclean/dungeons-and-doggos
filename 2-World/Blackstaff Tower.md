## Description
### Exterior

- **Structure:** Blackstaff Tower rises tall and slender against the skyline of Waterdeep, its structure crafted from seamless, polished onyx. The tower appears almost like a single piece of sculpted stone, its surface smooth and reflective, giving it an eerily perfect look.
    
- **Color and Texture:** The onyx exterior is a deep, lustrous black that seems to absorb the light around it, making the tower appear both solid and ethereal. Subtle veins of white and dark gray run through the stone, adding depth and an organic, marbled pattern that shimmers in the changing light of day and night.
    
- **Details:** Intricate arcane symbols and runes are etched into the onyx surface, glowing faintly with a silvery light. These markings are both decorative and functional, serving as wards and enchantments to protect the tower and its occupants.
    

### Entrance

- **Main Door:** The entrance to Blackstaff Tower is a grand archway, framed by ornate carvings of mythical creatures and magical motifs. The door itself is made of blackened steel, embossed with the symbol of the Blackstaff—a powerful magical staff crossed with a silver dragon.
    
- **Guardians:** Flanking the entrance are two statues carved from the same onyx as the tower. These statues depict majestic dragons, their eyes set with gemstones that glint menacingly. It's rumored that these statues can come to life to defend the tower from intruders.
    

### Interior

- **Entrance Hall:** Stepping inside, visitors find themselves in a vast hall with walls of polished onyx, reflecting flickering torchlight and the ambient glow of magical orbs. The floor is an intricate mosaic of black and white tiles, forming arcane patterns that shift subtly as if alive.
    
- **Staircases:** A grand, spiraling staircase of onyx and wrought iron winds its way up the tower’s central shaft. The steps are worn smooth by centuries of use, but still exude a sense of strength and durability.
    

### Rooms and Levels

- **Library:** One of the most impressive rooms within the tower is the library, where shelves of ancient tomes and scrolls stretch up to the high ceiling. The books are illuminated by floating orbs of light that hover above the tables, casting a soft glow. The onyx walls here are lined with silver filigree, depicting scenes of legendary mages and battles.
    
- **Laboratories:** Various magical laboratories are scattered throughout the tower, each dedicated to different schools of magic. These rooms are filled with mystical apparatus, alchemical ingredients, and artifacts, all meticulously organized and maintained. The onyx walls are inlaid with arcane circles and symbols that aid in spellcasting and research.
    
- **Private Quarters:** The private chambers of the Blackstaff and other high-ranking mages are luxurious yet austere, combining comfort with practicality. The onyx theme continues here, with plush furnishings in dark velvets and silks, and large windows offering panoramic views of Waterdeep.
    

### Top of the Tower

- **Observation Deck:** The topmost level of Blackstaff Tower is an open observation deck, ringed by a parapet of onyx spires. From here, the Blackstaff can observe the city below and the skies above, often using this vantage point for divination and star-gazing. The floor is embedded with a giant arcane circle that serves as a teleportation nexus and ritual site.
    
- **Beacon:** At the very peak of the tower, a powerful beacon of magical energy pulses with a steady rhythm, visible across the city. This beacon serves as a symbol of the Blackstaff’s authority and is a potent source of arcane power, drawing energy from the Weave itself.
    

### Ambiance

- **Aura:** The entire tower radiates a palpable aura of magic. Visitors often feel a tingling sensation upon entering, as if the air is charged with arcane energy. The tower seems to hum softly, a testament to the powerful spells and enchantments woven into its very structure.
    
- **Mystique:** Blackstaff Tower, with its onyx appearance, stands as an enigmatic monument to magical prowess. Its dark, glossy exterior and intricately adorned interior make it a place of wonder and intimidation, respected and revered by all who lay eyes upon it.
    

In summary, Blackstaff Tower, with its onyx-like appearance, is an awe-inspiring and formidable structure that reflects the immense magical power and authority of the Blackstaff. Its dark elegance and arcane embellishments make it a true icon in the city of Waterdeep.
