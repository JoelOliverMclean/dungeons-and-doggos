The **Grimoire of Taz'Rhul** is a twisted and powerful tome penned (or perhaps manifested) by **Taz'Rhul**, a dark entity tied to elemental power and control. The book’s contents reflect this power, blending elemental manipulation with sinister magic designed to bend minds, enslave souls, and reshape reality.

### **Lore of Taz'Rhul**

Taz'Rhul is an enigmatic figure, believed to be a fallen primordial, a corrupted archmage, or even an elemental overlord who sought dominion over all forces of creation. Legends suggest that Taz'Rhul’s influence transcends planar boundaries, allowing their power to seep into mortal realms through cursed artifacts like the **Grimoire**.

The **Grimoire** is whispered to have been forged in an obsidian crucible deep within the Plane of Earth, its pages inked in molten gold and ash. Its magic revolves around **binding**, **enslavement**, and **domination**, especially over elemental beings — though its power extends far beyond that.

### **The Grimoire’s Contents**

The **Grimoire of Taz'Rhul** is a dense, chaotic text with sections written in **Primordial (Ignan dialect)**, **Infernal**, and **Abyssal**, with fractured **Draconic** runes laced between the passages. Some portions appear to shift language based on the reader’s emotional state or proximity to elemental energy.

The book is divided into **five major sections**, each dedicated to a twisted aspect of elemental control:

1. **The Fetters of the Burning Chain**
    - Describes brutal methods for binding elementals — especially those of fire — with glyphs that scorch themselves into flesh or stone. The **Soulbind Ritual** resides in this section, intended for controlling powerful beings.
    - Those bound this way exist in torment, their minds shattered unless freed.
2. **The Whispering Breath**
    - Manipulates the **air** and minds alike. Spells here mimic enchantment magic, forcing others to submit to the reader’s will.
    - A hidden passage reveals the curse of the book itself — a glyph resembling a spiraling gust that burrows into the mind.
3. **The Ironclad Oath**
    - This section details powerful abjuration magics tied to **earth** and endurance. Shields of stone, unbreakable armor, and rituals that turn flesh to granite are described.
    - This section also reveals the **Warden's Curse**, an insidious enchantment designed to protect the book itself.
4. **The Drowned Chain**
    - Focused on **water** and binding through relentless pressure. Rituals to drown foes from within or ensnare them in suffocating spheres are described.
    - This chapter’s pages are often damp, with ink that runs and reforms itself.
5. **The Ember’s Toll**
    - A corrupted form of **divination** magic that allows glimpses of potential futures — but only those where Taz'Rhul's dominance is inevitable.
    - Foresight from this section often misleads or manipulates the reader into taking actions that strengthen Taz'Rhul’s influence.

### **The Curse: The Warden's Bond**

The **Warden's Curse** binds those who fail a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** (or higher, if you prefer). The curse manifests as follows:

**1. Obsessive Protection:**

- The cursed individual becomes **compulsively obsessed** with protecting the book. They will instinctively act to prevent theft or damage, even if it means harming allies.
- If the book is removed from their sight for more than 1 minute, they will experience rising anxiety, progressing to a debilitating panic if it’s gone for over an hour.

**2. The Binding Glyph:**

- A glowing mark — resembling a twisting spiral of chains — appears somewhere on their body. It may burn or throb painfully if the book is endangered.
- Destroying this glyph requires a **Remove Curse** spell or a ritual inscribed within the book itself (a cruel safeguard ensuring only those who understand the book can break the bond).

**3. Taz'Rhul's Whisper:**

- Over time, the cursed individual will begin to hear Taz'Rhul’s voice — a gravelly, distant whisper encouraging domination, control, and violence.
- Prolonged exposure may result in subtle personality changes, causing paranoia, arrogance, and manipulative tendencies.

**4. The Sleeper's Defense:**

- If the cursed individual falls unconscious or sleeps, the glyph manifests a **Stone Guardian** (earth elemental-like entity) that emerges from the ground and protects the Grimoire.

### **Breaking the Curse**

- The most straightforward solution is **Remove Curse**, but doing so requires someone physically holding the Grimoire for the spell to take effect. This is dangerous, as they risk being cursed themselves.
- Alternatively, the **Grimoire of Taz'Rhul** contains a ritual that safely severs the curse — but this ritual requires rare components such as
    - **Ash from a fire elemental’s heart**
    - **A tear willingly given by a water elemental**
    - **A stone shaped by the hand of a dao** (earth genie)
    - **A feather from an air elemental's manifested form**

The ritual also demands someone be near death during its casting — Taz'Rhul’s twisted demand for power.

### **Unwilling Defenses of the Grimoire of Taz'Rhul**

When a cursed individual has their hold on the **Grimoire of Taz'Rhul** threatened — whether by force, theft, or even deception — they must make a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw**. On a failure, the Grimoire taps into its malevolent power to **unleash a defensive effect**. Roll 1d12 on the table below:

### **d12 — Grimoire’s Unwilling Defenses**

|Roll|Effect|
|---|---|
|**1**|**Chains of Ash** — Chains made of blackened soot lash out from the Grimoire, attempting to grapple the nearest non-cursed creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a **DC 15 Strength saving throw** or become **Restrained** for 1 minute. At the end of each of their turns, they can repeat the save.|
|**2**|**Ignition Surge** — The Grimoire radiates intense heat, forcing all creatures within 10 feet to make a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw** or take **3d6 fire damage** (half on a success). The cursed individual is immune to this effect.|
|**3**|**Voice of Taz’Rhul** — The cursed individual involuntarily shouts in **Primordial (Ignan)**, compelling nearby creatures to falter. All creatures within 30 feet that can hear the shout must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or become **Frightened** for 1 minute. Affected creatures can attempt the save again at the end of each turn.|
|**4**|**Stonefist** — The cursed individual’s arm encases itself in jagged stone. They must immediately make a melee spell attack (+6 to hit) against the nearest creature, dealing **3d10 bludgeoning damage** on a hit. The stone encasing their arm crumbles afterward.|
|**5**|**Gasping Current** — A twisting sphere of suffocating water erupts from the Grimoire. One creature within 30 feet must succeed on a **DC 15 Strength saving throw** or become **Restrained** as water coils around them. They can attempt to break free as an action, rolling the same save.|
|**6**|**The Sentinel's Glare** — The Grimoire's sigil glows with burning crimson light. The cursed individual’s eyes blaze, forcing one target within 15 feet to succeed on a **DC 15 Charisma saving throw** or become **Paralyzed** for 1 minute. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.|
|**7**|**The Earthen Guard** — A **Medium-sized Earth Elemental** erupts from the ground within 5 feet of the Grimoire. It defends the book for 1 minute or until slain. The cursed individual has no control over this creature.|
|**8**|**Surging Vortex** — A sudden burst of wind erupts in a 20-foot radius centered on the Grimoire. All creatures in the area must succeed on a **DC 15 Strength saving throw** or be flung **10 feet** away from the book and knocked **Prone**.|
|**9**|**Fingers of Coal** — The cursed individual involuntarily casts **Heat Metal** (3rd-level) on the nearest metal object they can see. They have no control over what target is chosen.|
|**10**|**Pact Mark** — A burning sigil of Taz'Rhul brands itself on one creature within 30 feet. The creature must succeed on a **DC 15 Charisma saving throw** or become cursed for 1 hour. While cursed in this way, they have **disadvantage on saving throws against being Charmed or Frightened**.|
|**11**|**Chains of the Unseen** — Spectral chains form an impenetrable barrier around the Grimoire for 1 minute. The Grimoire cannot be touched or moved unless the chains are dispelled (requiring **Dispel Magic** or a **DC 18 Strength (Athletics)** check).|
|**12**|**Taz'Rhul's Triumph** — The cursed individual involuntarily casts **Wall of Fire** (4th-level), forming a protective barrier that encircles the Grimoire in a 10-foot radius. The wall remains for 1 minute or until dispelled. The cursed individual does not have concentration on this effect — it endures regardless of their actions.|

### **Optional Rule: Escalating Consequences**

For an added layer of tension, consider this twist:

- **First Failure:** Roll on the table normally.
- **Second Failure:** The cursed individual automatically rolls with **disadvantage** on the table.
- **Third Failure:** Roll **twice** and apply **both effects** as the Grimoire’s malevolent influence grows stronger.

### **Narrative Flavor for the Curse**

- When these effects trigger, the cursed individual might feel an unnatural compulsion — as if their hands are moving on their own, or their voice rises without warning.
- The defensive spells may manifest in twisted forms of familiar spells, hinting that the Grimoire corrupts common magic to suit its own ends.
- The cursed individual may even hear whispers of **Taz'Rhul's voice** encouraging the violence or whispering approval when harm is done.
