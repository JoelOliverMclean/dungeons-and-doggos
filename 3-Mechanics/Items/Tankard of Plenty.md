This golden stein is decorated with dancing dwarves and grain patterns. If you speak the command word (“Illefarn”) while grasping the handle, the tankard fills with three pints of rich dwarven ale. The tankard has 3 charges. Using the tankard’s property expends 1 charge, and the tankard regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
