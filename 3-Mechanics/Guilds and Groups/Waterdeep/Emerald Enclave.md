## About
The Emerald Enclave is a society of mainly druids, but also open to any members who regard the sanctity of the natural world with the utmost importance. They are concerned with keeping the natural order and protecting nature from powers who would seek to corrupt it or commit crimes against it. They have a reputation for being incredibly savage to those they deem guilty.
