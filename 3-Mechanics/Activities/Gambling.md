#### Liar's Dice
Liar's dice is a game of deception. For 2+ players, each player starts with 5d6 in an opaque cup. Bets are placed before each round. 

The game starts with everyone rolling their dice in the cup and placing the cup open side down, hiding their dice from the other players, and then all peeking at their own dice. If a die is stacked, that player re-rolls. 

Once rolled, the starting player makes a bet. A bet is made up of 2 numbers, a count and a face value. For example, the first player can bet "7 4s". This means they believe there are at least 7 6s among all the dice in the game. 1s are wild and count towards any guess total. 

The round plays out clockwise, with each player either raising or challenging the previous. 
- To raise the bet, the player can choose to increase 1 or both numbers e.g. "8 4s", "7 5s" or "8 5s". 
- If a player challenges the bet, all dice are revealed. Counting up all the dice with the value bet (or 1) if the bet exceeds the total the challenger is successful this round and the better loses a die. If the bet count is at equal to or less than the actual count then the challenger loses a die. 

The game continues until all but 1 player has lost all their dice. That player is the winner and takes the pot!

#### Dicejack
The aim of Dicejack is to get as close to 12 as possible without going over. 

Each player has 3d6 and all bet an amount before the round starts. 

They all roll 2d6 secretly (in a cup and hidden, for example) and note the total in their head. They can then roll an optional 3rd d6 (not hidden) adding it's roll to the total.  

Any player who goes over 12 instantly loses the round. The highest total and closest to 12 takes the pot (split on a tie)

If player's are playing against a dealer, they don't compare against each other, but against the dealer. 

The dealer must roll the 3rd dice if their total is 8 or lower and must hold if it is 9 or higher.

Beating the dealer gets 2x their bet, matching the dealer gets their bet back, and losing loses. If the dealer busts, all player's who didn't bust, win.

> [!info]- Baker's Dozen Variant
> In this variant, the target is 13 (hence baker's dozen) and only 1 of the initial 2d6 rolls are hidden. Also player's can roll as many extra dice as they want trying to get as close to 13 as possible without going bust.
> 
> In a dealer situation, the dealer must roll additional dice until their score is over 9.

#### Ships & Fleets
In this game, each player play's with 3d6 and each round consists of 3 rolls. Bets are placed before each round. 

The first roll is with all 3 dice. The player can choose to then re-roll any number of their dice up to 2 more times. 

To calculate your score you add up the numbers of the dice at the end of the round, this is your ship total. However, if you rolled three of a kind, this is called a Fleet and beats any number of ships, but loses to a fleet of a higher face value. 

#### Roulette 
Simple game where player's place a bet on up to 4 numbers from 1-20 (each number is a separate bet). The dealer (GM) rolls a d20 and whoever placed a bet on the result wins 4x the amount they bet on that number. 

#### Drinking Game
A simple game of constitution where all characters take 1 drink at a time of the same drink. After each drink, each player makes a constitution saving throw, starting at a DC 10 for round 1 and increasing by 1 each round. 2 fails means you're out of the game. Can be played 1v1 or last man standing. Bets placed before drinking starts.
