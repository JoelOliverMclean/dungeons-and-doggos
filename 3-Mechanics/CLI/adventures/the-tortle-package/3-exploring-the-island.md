# Exploring the Island
*Source: The Tortle Package, p. 5* 

A rain forest covers the relatively flat northwest corner of the island. This rain forest is surrounded by grassy hills to the north, sandy beaches to the east and west, and mountains to the south. The tortle fort of Ahoyhoy stands on the west coast, where the edge of the rain forest and the mountains meet.

## Random Encounters

Roll a `d20` three times per day of game time, checking for encounters each morning, afternoon, and evening or night. A random encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher. Roll a `d100` and check the Snout of Omgar Encounters table for the appropriate terrain. After determining what the characters encounter, you can use the information presented below to bring the encounter to life. Let the players narrate their way through avoiding easy encounters, or increase the difficulty of easy encounters to keep them exciting.

Random encounters aren't tailored to characters of a particular level. If the characters encounter hostile creatures beyond their ability to defeat, give them opportunities to run, hide, negotiate, or otherwise avoid certain death. You can also have other creatures arrive and provide a distraction that the characters can use to make their escape. For example, if a character needs to make a crucial ability check or saving throw, a chwinga (see Tomb of Annihilation) might appear, cast [guidance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance.md) or [resistance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/resistance.md) on the character, and then disappear on its next turn.

![Random Encounters; Snout of Omgar Encounters](/3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/random-encounters-snout-of-omgar-encounters-ttp.md)

### Almiraj

The characters spot an almiraj (see Tomb of Annihilation) roughly 60 feet away. The almiraj runs from any creature that approaches within 30 feet of it. Any character who successfully traps the almiraj can use an action to make a DC 14 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check. If the check succeeds, the almiraj becomes calm and doesn't attack the character or run away unless it feels threatened or is harmed.

### Axe Beaks

A flock of `1d6+3` [axe beaks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/axe-beak.md) stampede toward the characters, slashing at anyone they can reach.

### Baboons

A pack of `3d6` [baboons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/baboon.md) has adapted to living in small mountain caves but scurry down to the tree line in search of food. The baboons can be placated by tossing each of them a day's supply of food. Otherwise, they attack, fleeing once their numbers are reduced by half.

### Blood Hawks

These bright red birds are common sights on the island. They feed on [flying snakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/flying-snake.md), and tortles hunt them for sport. [Blood hawks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/blood-hawk.md) appear only during the day, and a typical encounter consists of `2d6` [blood hawks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/blood-hawk.md) that attack until half of them are slain. If this encounter is rolled at night, treat it as no encounter.

### Cannibals

Human cannibals from the mainland use canoes to reach the island. They come in search of shipwreck survivors to hunt and eat. The characters encounter `3d6` hostile cannibals (CE male and female Chultan human [tribal warriors](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/tribal-warrior.md)) who fight to the death. They wear leather masks made from skinned human faces and crude jewelry made from human bones and teeth.

### Chwinga

A chwinga (see Tomb of Annihilation) takes an interest in the characters. It attempts to steal something valuable from an unguarded pack, but is noticed by any character who has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 17 or higher. The chwinga always leaves something else in exchange: a pretty shell, a handful of nuts, or an uncut gemstone (10 gp).

### Dimetrodons

If the characters are traveling near the shore, they see `1d4` [dimetrodons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/dimetrodon-mpmm.md) (see Tomb of Annihilation or "Volo's Guide to Monsters") wallowing in shallow pools of water. These creatures turn hostile if disturbed. If the characters are nowhere near water or camped for the night, the dimetrodons are on the move and attack anything in their path.

### Dolphins

The party encounters `2d4` [dolphins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/dolphin-mpmm.md) (see "Volo's Guide to Monsters") or 1 [killer whale](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/killer-whale.md) if you prefer. If the characters use magic to speak with the creatures, they can receive directions to the nearest coastal settlement.

### Eblis

If the characters are on the move when this encounter occurs, they stumble across `1d4+2` eblis (see Tomb of Annihilation) on the hunt for [lizards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/lizard.md) or [flying snakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/flying-snake.md) to eat. The eblis politely offer to trade information for treasure. For 50 gp worth of treasure, they will point the adventurers in the direction of nearby landmarks. The eblis attack if the characters refuse to trade and are outnumbered. They flee if half of them are killed or incapacitated. If this encounter occurs while the party is camped, the eblis sneak into the camp and try to drag one character away.

### Flail Snail

Characters spot the slimy trail of a [flail snail](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/flail-snail-mpmm.md) (see Tomb of Annihilation or "Volo's Guide to Monsters"). If they decide to follow it, a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check correctly deduces which direction the snail was traveling. The snail wants to be left alone and attacks only those who antagonize it.

### Flying Snakes

The party encounters `1d6` [flying snakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/flying-snake.md). These snakes attack only when threatened. A flying snake that is successfully grappled can be stuffed in a sack or other soft container. After 1 hour of confinement, the snake settles down. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check can remove a calm snake from the container without causing it to attack or fly away.

### Geonids

Geonids live in mountain caves, but they can be encountered anywhere on the island. If the encounter occurs during the day, the characters are ambushed by `2d4` [geonids](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/geonid-ttp.md) disguised as small boulders. They demand at least 25 gp worth of treasure for safe passage throughout their territory. If the encounter occurs at night, `3d6` [geonids](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/geonid-ttp.md) attempt to sneak into the party's camp and steal food.

### Giant Lizards

The characters encounter `1d6` [giant lizards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-lizard.md). During the day, the lizards are well fed and flee if attacked; at night, they turn aggressive and attack characters who come within 30 feet of them. The Snout of Omgar is home to hundreds of giant lizards. Tortles hunt them for their leather and meat, and they use the lizards' bones and teeth to make crude jewelry.

### Giant Snapping Turtle

These aggressive monsters like to bask on the island's warm rocks and shores, but occasionally one will venture inland to find food. The characters encounter a lone giant snapping turtle (see Tomb of Annihilation) and can avoid it by keeping their distance.

### Jaculis

Without warning, `1d6` jaculis (see Tomb of Annihilation) launch themselves at the party from trees or mountain ledges. Any character with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of 14 or higher spots the jaculis before they strike, but all others are surprised.

### Marine Decapus

This marine [decapus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/decapus-ttp.md) preys on swimmers and will even snatch a rower from a canoe (though it must use half of its tentacles to grab hold of the vessel before doing so). The decapus withdraws into the depths if it loses more than half of its hit points.

### Plesiosaurus

The characters blunder into the hunting ground of a hungry [plesiosaurus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/plesiosaurus.md) that attacks passing canoes or anything else it can wrap its jaws around.

### Pteranodons

[Pteranodons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/pteranodon.md) roost atop the mountains and gather in flocks to fish along the island's shores. The characters spot `1d6` [pteranodons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/pteranodon.md) nearby. The pteranodons keep their distance and attack only if threatened.

### Reef Sharks

The water surrounding the island is home to thousands of [reef sharks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/reef-shark.md) that are drawn by the scent of blood in the water. A swimmer with an open, bleeding wound is accosted by `1d6` [reef sharks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/reef-shark.md) if it spends more than 1 minute in the water.

### Stirges

The Snout of Omgar has plenty of caves, ruins, and trees in which [stirges](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/stirge.md) can hide. By day, the characters disturb `2d6` [stirges](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/stirge.md) as they move through the jungle. At night, the same number of stirges descend on the party's camp.

### Topis

The characters are attacked by `1d4+2` [topis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/topi-ttp.md) (see "[Topi](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/topi-ttp.md)") that escaped from the Typhoon Palace.

### Tortle

The characters encounter a [tortle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/tortle-mpmm.md) (see "[Tortles](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/tortle-mpmm.md)"). For suggested tortle names, see "[Tortle Names](/3-Mechanics/CLI/races/tortle-mpmm.md)". If this encounter occurs near the coast, the tortle is a fisher with a [fishing pole](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/fishing-tackle.md), a [net](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/net.md), and a fish basket. If the encounter occurs inland, the tortle is hunting snakes, [lizards](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/lizard.md), [axe beaks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/axe-beak.md), or [blood hawks](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/blood-hawk.md). The tortle tries to be helpful. If the characters are looking for a settlement where they can rest and trade, the tortle points them in the direction of Ahoyhoy. If they're looking for adventure, it points them in the direction of the Typhoon Palace. If a mystery is what they seek, it points them in the direction of the Shrine of Fangs. If they're looking for shipwrecks to plunder, it directs them toward High Horn. If they're looking for a good time, the tortle gives them directions to the Mud Pits of Florrb.
