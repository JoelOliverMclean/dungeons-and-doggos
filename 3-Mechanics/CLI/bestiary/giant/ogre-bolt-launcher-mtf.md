## Ogre Bolt Launcher

A bolt launcher carries a gigantic crossbow—a weapon so large it's essentially an ogre-held ballista. An ogre bolt launcher can load this immense weapon and loose its deadly missile as quickly as a dwarf handles a crossbow. The bolts are so large that few ogres can carry more than a half-dozen at a time, but bolt launchers have been known to uproot small trees or tear beams out of buildings and launch those when their ammunition runs low.

## Ogres

Ogres are infamously dim-witted, but with enough time and patience, some of them can be trained to carry out specialized missions in battle. The names they are given—the battering ram, the bolt launcher, the chain brute, and the howdah—reflect their particular functions. These jobs are simple, but they're tailored to take advantage of an ogre's strengths.
