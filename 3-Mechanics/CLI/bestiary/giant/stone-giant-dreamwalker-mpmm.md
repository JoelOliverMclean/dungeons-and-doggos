## Traits

***Dreamwalker's Charm.*** An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of the giant must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, provided that the giant isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). On a failed save, the creature is [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the giant. A creature [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the saving throw, the creature is immune to this giant's Dreamwalker's Charm for 24 hours.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giant makes two Greatclub or Rock attacks.

***Greatclub.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (`4d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`3d10 + 6`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Petrifying Touch.*** The giant touches one Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet of it that is [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by it. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified), and the giant can adhere the target to its stony body. [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spells and other magic that can undo petrification have no effect on a [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) creature adhered to the giant unless the giant is dead, in which case the magic works normally, freeing the [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) creature as well as ending the [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition on it.
