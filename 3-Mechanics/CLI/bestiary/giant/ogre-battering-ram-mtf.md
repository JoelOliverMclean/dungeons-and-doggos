## Ogre Battering Ram

An ogre battering ram carries an enormous club used primarily for bashing doors into kindling, but which also works well for smashing foes. These ogres are drilled in two simple tasks: rushing forward to shatter enemy fortifications, and using their weapons to force an advancing enemy to halt.

## Ogres

Ogres are infamously dim-witted, but with enough time and patience, some of them can be trained to carry out specialized missions in battle. The names they are given—the battering ram, the bolt launcher, the chain brute, and the howdah—reflect their particular functions. These jobs are simple, but they're tailored to take advantage of an ogre's strengths.
