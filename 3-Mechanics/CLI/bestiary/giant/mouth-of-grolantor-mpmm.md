## Traits

***Mouth of Chaos.*** The giant is immune to the [confusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md) spell.

On each of its turns, the giant uses all its movement to move toward the nearest creature or whatever else it might perceive as food. Roll a `d10` at the start of each of the giant's turns to determine its action for that turn:

- **1–3.** The giant makes three Fist attacks against one random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, the giant flies into a rage and gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn.  
- **4–5.** The giant makes one Fist attack against each creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, the giant makes one Fist attack against itself.  
- **6–7.** The giant makes one Bite attack against one random creature within reach. If no other creatures are within reach, its eyes glaze over and it is [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the start of its next turn.  
- **8–10.** The giant makes one Bite attack and two Fist attacks against one random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, the giant flies into a rage and gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn.  

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 15 (`3d6 + 5`) piercing damage, and the giant magically regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`3d8 + 5`) bludgeoning damage.
