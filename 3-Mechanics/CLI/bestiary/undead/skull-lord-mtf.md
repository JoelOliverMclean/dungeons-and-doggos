## Skull Lord

The skull lords have claimed vast regions of the Shadowfell as their dominion. From these blighted lands, they wage war against their rivals, commanding hordes of undead in a bid to establish dominance. Yet skull lords always prove to be their own worst enemies; as a combined being born from three hateful individuals, they constantly plot against themselves.

## Creatures of Betrayal

Infighting and treachery brought the skull lords into existence. The first of them appeared in the aftermath of Vecna's bid to conquer the world of Greyhawk, after the vampire Kas betrayed Vecna and took his eye and hand. In the confusion resulting from this turn of events, Vecna's warlords turned against each other, and the dark one's plans were dashed. In a rage, Vecna gathered up his generals and captains and bound them in groups of three, fusing them into undead abominations cursed to fight among themselves for all time. Since the first skull lords were exiled into shadow, others have joined them, typically after being created from other leaders who betrayed their masters.

## Undead Nature

A skull lord doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the skull lord fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Master of the Grave.*** While within 30 feet of the skull lord, any undead ally of the skull lord makes saving throws with advantage, and that ally regains `1d6` hit points whenever it starts its turn there.

***Evasion.*** If the skull lord is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half the damage, the skull lord instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
