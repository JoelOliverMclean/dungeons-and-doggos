## Traits

***Annihilating Aura.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the nightwalker must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (`6d6`) necrotic damage. Undead are immune to this aura.

***Life Eater.*** A creature dies if reduced to 0 hit points by the nightwalker and can't be revived except by a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell.

***Unusual Nature.*** The nightwalker doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The nightwalker makes two Enervating Focus attacks, one of which can be replaced by Finger of Doom, if available.

***Enervating Focus.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (`5d8 + 6`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

***Finger of Doom (Recharge 6).*** The nightwalker points at one creature it can see within 300 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or take 39 (`6d12`) necrotic damage and become [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the end of the nightwalker's next turn. While [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) in this way, the creature is also [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed). If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the nightwalker's Finger of Doom for the next 24 hours.
