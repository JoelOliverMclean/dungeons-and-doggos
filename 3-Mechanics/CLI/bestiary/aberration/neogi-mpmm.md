## Traits

***Mental Fortitude.*** The neogi has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened), and magic can't put the neogi to sleep.

***Spider Climb.*** The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The neogi makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`2d4 + 3`) slashing damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The neogi targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the neogi for 1 day, or until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target obeys the neogi's commands and can't take reactions, and the neogi and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 1 mile. Whenever the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
