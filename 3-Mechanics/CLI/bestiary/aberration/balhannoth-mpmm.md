***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If the balhannoth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The balhannoth makes one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`3d10 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15) and is moved up to 5 feet toward the balhannoth. Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the balhannoth can't use this tentacle against other targets. The balhannoth has four tentacles.
