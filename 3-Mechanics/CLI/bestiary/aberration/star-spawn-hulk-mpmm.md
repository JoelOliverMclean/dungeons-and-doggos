## Traits

***Psychic Mirror.*** If the hulk takes psychic damage, each creature within 10 feet of the hulk takes that damage instead; the hulk takes none of the damage. In addition, the hulk's thoughts and location can't be discerned by magic.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hulk makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target also takes 9 (`2d8`) psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of the target's next turn.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d8 + 5`) bludgeoning damage.

***Reaping Arms (Recharge 5-6).*** The hulk makes a separate Slam attack against each creature within 10 feet of it. Each creature that is hit must also succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).
