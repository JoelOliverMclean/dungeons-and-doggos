## Actions

***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until this grapple ends.

***Extract Brain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) humanoid [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by Captain N'ghathrod. *Hit:* The target takes 55 (`10d10`) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, Captain N'ghathrod kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** Captain N'ghathrod magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (`4d8 + 4`) psychic damage and be [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Lair actions

When fighting aboard the Scavenger, N'ghathrod can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), N'ghathrod can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- N'ghathrod creates a magical duplicate of itself anywhere aboard the ship. Formed out of psionic energy, this duplicate lasts until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until it is dispelled (DC 15), or until N'ghathrod takes another lair action. The duplicate has the statistics of a normal mind flayer and is friendly toward N'ghathrod, but not under its control. It cannot leave the Scavenger.  
- N'ghathrod fills all interior areas of the ship with mind-warping images and sounds of the Far Realm that last until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature that isn't an aberration that starts its turn inside the ship must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) psychic damage.
