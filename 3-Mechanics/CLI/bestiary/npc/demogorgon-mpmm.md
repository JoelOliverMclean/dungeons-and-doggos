## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Demogorgon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Demogorgon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Two Heads.*** Demogorgon has advantage on saving throws against being [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned), or knocked [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious).

***Spellcasting.*** Demogorgon casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 23):

**At will**: [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [major image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md)

**1/day each**: [feeblemind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/feeblemind.md), [project image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/project-image.md)

**3/day each**: [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), [fear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear.md), [telekinesis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/telekinesis.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Demogorgon makes two Tentacle attacks. He can replace one attack with a use of Gaze.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (`3d12 + 9`) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

***Gaze.*** Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature he can see within 120 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of the following effects (choose one or roll a `d6`):

- **1–2 Beguiling Gaze.** The target is [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the start of Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.  
- **3–4 Confusing Gaze.** The target suffers the effect of the [confusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md) spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell.  
- **5–6 Hypnotic Gaze.** The target is [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target uses its action, reaction, and movement.  

## Legendary Actions

***Gaze.*** Demogorgon uses Gaze and must use either Beguiling Gaze or Confusing Gaze.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`2d10 + 9`) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (`2d10`) necrotic damage.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** Demogorgon uses Spellcasting.
