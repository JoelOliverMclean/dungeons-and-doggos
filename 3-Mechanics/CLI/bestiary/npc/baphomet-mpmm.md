## Traits

***Labyrinthine Recall.*** Baphomet can perfectly recall any path he has traveled, and he is immune to the [maze](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/maze.md) spell.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Baphomet fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Baphomet has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Baphomet casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

**1/day**: [teleport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport.md)

**3/day each**: [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), [dominate beast](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-beast.md), [maze](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/maze.md), [wall of stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-stone.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Baphomet makes one Bite attack, one Gore attack, and one Heartcleaver attack. He also uses Frightful Presence.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`2d8 + 10`) piercing damage.

***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d6 + 10`) piercing damage. If Baphomet moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 16 (`3d10`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Heartcleaver.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (`2d10 + 10`) force damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Baphomet's choice within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. These later saves have disadvantage if Baphomet is within line of sight of the creature.

If a creature succeeds on any of these saves or the effect ends on it, the creature is immune to Baphomet's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

## Legendary Actions

***Heartcleaver Attack.*** Baphomet makes one Heartcleaver attack.

***Charge (Costs 2 Actions).*** Baphomet moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks, then makes a Gore attack.
