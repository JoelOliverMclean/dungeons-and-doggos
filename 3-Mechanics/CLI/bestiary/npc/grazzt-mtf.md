## Graz'zt

The appearance of the Dark Prince is a warning that not all beautiful things are good. Standing nearly nine feet tall, Graz'zt strikes the perfect figure of untamed desire, every plane and curve of his body, every glance of his burning eyes, promising a mixture of pleasure and pain. A subtle wrongness pervades his beauty, from the cruel cast of his features to the six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. Graz'zt can also transform himself at will, appearing in any humanoid form that pleases him, or his onlookers, all equally tempting in their own ways.

Graz'zt surrounds himself with the finest of things and the most attractive of servants, and he adorns himself in silks and leathers both striking and disturbing in their workmanship. His lair, and those of his cultists, are pleasure palaces where nothing is forbidden, save moderation or kindness.

The dark Prince of Pleasure considers restriction the only sin, and takes what he wants. Cults devoted to him are secret societies of indulgence, often using their debauchery to subjugate others through blackmail, addiction, and manipulation. They frequently wear alabaster masks with ecstatic expressions and ostentatious dress and body ornamentation to their secret assignations.

Although he prefers charm and subtle manipulation, Graz'zt is capable of terrible violence when provoked. He wields the greatsword Angdrelve, also called Wave of Sorrow, its wavy, razor-edged blade dripping acid at his command.

## Graz'zt's Lair

Graz'zt's principal lair is his Argent Palace, a grandiose structure in the city of Zelatar, found within his Abyssal domain of Azzatar. Graz'zt's maddening influence radiates outward in a tangible ripple, warping reality around him. Given enough time in a single location, Graz'zt can twist it with his madness. Graz'zt's lair is a den of ostentation and hedonism. It is adorned with finery and decorations so decadent that even the wealthiest of mortals would blush at the excess. Within Graz'zt's lairs, followers, thralls, and subjects alike are forced to slake Graz'zt's thirst for pageantry and pleasure.

## Traits

***Shapechanger.*** Graz'zt can use his action to polymorph into a form that resembles a Medium humanoid, or back into his true form. Aside from his size, his statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Graz'zt fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Graz'zt has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Graz'zt's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Graz'zt's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md), [crown of madness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/crown-of-madness.md), [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), [dissonant whispers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dissonant-whispers.md)

**1/day each**: [dominate monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-monster.md), [greater invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-invisibility.md)

**3/day each**: [counterspell](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/counterspell.md), [darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md), [dominate person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-person.md), [sanctuary](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sanctuary.md), [telekinesis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/telekinesis.md), [teleport](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Graz'zt attacks twice with Wave of Sorrow.

***Wave of Sorrow (Greatsword).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`4d6 + 6`) slashing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) acid damage.

***Teleport.*** Graz'zt magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** Graz'zt attacks once with Wave of Sorrow.

***Dance, My Puppet.*** One creature [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by Graz'zt that Graz'zt can see must use its reaction to move up to its speed as Graz'zt directs.

***Sow Discord.*** Graz'zt casts [crown of madness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/crown-of-madness.md) or dissonant whispers.

***Teleport.*** Graz'zt uses his Teleport action.

## Lair actions

On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Graz'zt can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Graz'zt casts the [command](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/command.md) spell on every creature of his choice in the lair. He needn't see each one, but he must be aware that an individual is in the lair to target that creature. He issues the same command to all the targets.  
- Smooth surfaces within the lair become as reflective as a polished mirror. Until a different lair action is used, creatures within the lair have disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Graz'zt's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- Flat surfaces within 1 mile of the lair that are made of stone or metal become highly reflective, as though polished to a shine. These surfaces become supernaturally mirrorlike.  
- Wild beasts within 6 miles of the lair break into frequent conflicts and coupling, mirroring the behavior that occurs during their mating seasons.  
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Graz'zt table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  

If Graz'zt dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

**Madness of Graz'zt.** If a creature goes mad in Graz'zt's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Graz'zt table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more on madness.
