# Cassiok Shadowdusk
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 287*  

Cassiok Shadowdusk is a middle-aged man transformed by prolonged exposure to the Far Realm. Although his head remains human, his body is that of a giant beetle that walks on its hind legs.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** Cassiok has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Special Equipment.*** Cassiok carries a [staff of power](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/staff-of-power.md) that grants him a +2 bonus to Armor Class, spell attack rolls, and saving throws. His insectoid physiology prevents him from making melee attacks with the staff. If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Cassiok uses his next action to break his staff in a retributive strike.

***Spellcasting.*** Cassiok is an 18th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). Cassiok can cast [disguise self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) and invisibility at will and has the following wizard spells prepared:
