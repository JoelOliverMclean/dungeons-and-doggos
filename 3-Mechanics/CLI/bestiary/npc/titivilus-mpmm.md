## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Titivilus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Titivilus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Regeneration.*** Titivilus regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes cold or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Titivilus dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Ventriloquism.*** Whenever Titivilus speaks, he can choose a point within 60 feet of him; his voice emanates from that point.

***Spellcasting.*** Titivilus casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 21):

**At will**: [alter self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alter-self.md), [major image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md), [nondetection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/nondetection.md), [sending](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md), [suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md)

**3/day each**: [mislead](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mislead.md), [modify memory](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/modify-memory.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Titivilus makes one Silver Sword attack, and he uses Frightful Word.

***Silver Sword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) force damage, or 9 (`1d10 + 4`) force damage if used with two hands, plus 16 (`3d10`) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the necrotic damage taken.

***Frightful Word.*** Titivilus targets one creature he can see within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of him for 1 minute. While [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) in this way, the target must take the [Dash](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action and move away from Titivilus by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move, in which case it needn't take the [Dash](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Teleport.*** Titivilus teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

***Twisting Words.*** Titivilus targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Charisma saving throw or become [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by Titivilus for 1 minute. The [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target can repeat the saving throw if Titivilus deals any damage to it. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to Titivilus's Twisting Words for 24 hours.

## Legendary Actions

***Corrupting Guidance.*** Titivilus uses Twisting Words. Alternatively, he targets one creature [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by him that is within 60 feet of him; that [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target must succeed on a DC 21 Charisma saving throw, or Titivilus decides how the target acts during its next turn.

***Teleport.*** Titivilus uses Teleport.

***Assault (Costs 2 Actions).*** Titivilus makes one Silver Sword attack, or he uses Frightful Word.
