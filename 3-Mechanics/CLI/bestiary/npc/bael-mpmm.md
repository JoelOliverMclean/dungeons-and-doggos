## Traits

***Dread.*** Any creature, other than a devil, that starts its turn within 10 feet of Bael must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of him until the start of its next turn. A creature succeeds on this saving throw automatically if Bael wishes it or if he is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Bael fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Bael have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Regeneration.*** Bael regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes cold or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Bael dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Spellcasting.*** Bael casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 21):

**At will**: [alter self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alter-self.md) (can become Medium), [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md), [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [major image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md)

**1/day**: [dominate monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-monster.md)
