## Traits

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede Zariel's [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Zariel fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Zariel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Regeneration.*** Zariel regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. Zariel dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Spellcasting.*** Zariel casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 26):

**At will**: [alter self](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alter-self.md) (can become Medium when changing her appearance), [detect evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md), [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md) (self only), [major image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md), [wall of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-fire.md)

**3/day each**: [blade barrier](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/blade-barrier.md), [dispel evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md), [finger of death](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/finger-of-death.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Zariel makes three Flail or Longsword attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Horrid Touch, if available.

***Flail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d8 + 8`) force damage plus 36 (`8d8`) fire damage.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d8 + 8`) radiant damage, or 19 (`2d10 + 8`) radiant damage when used with two hands, plus 36 (`8d8`) fire damage.

***Horrid Touch (Recharge 5-6).*** Zariel touches one creature within 10 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Constitution saving throw or take 44 (`8d10`) necrotic damage and be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. While [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, the target is [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened). The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Teleport.*** Zariel teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.

## Legendary Actions

***Teleport.*** Zariel uses Teleport.

***Immolating Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).*** Zariel turns her magical gaze toward one creature she can see within 120 feet of her and commands it to burn. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) fire damage.
