## Traits

***False Appearance.*** If the trapper is motionless on a floor, wall, or ceiling at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the trapper move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern that the trapper isn't part of the floor, wall, or ceiling.

***Spider Climb.*** The trapper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Smother.*** One Large or smaller creature within 10 feet of the trapper must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 13 (`3d6 + 3`) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (`1d6`) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. While [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) in this way, the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded), and deprived of air. The trapper can smother only one creature at a time.
