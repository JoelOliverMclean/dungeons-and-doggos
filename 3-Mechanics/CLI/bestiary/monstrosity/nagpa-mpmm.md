**At will**: [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [mage hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md), [message](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/message.md), [minor illusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md)

**1/day each**: [dominate person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-person.md), [etherealness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/etherealness.md), [feeblemind](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/feeblemind.md)

**2/day each**: [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball.md), [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md), [hold person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md), [suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md), [wall of fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-fire.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The nagpa makes three Staff or Deathly Ray attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

***Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`2d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage plus 24 (`7d6`) necrotic damage.

***Deathly Ray.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (`7d6 + 6`) necrotic damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Corruption.*** The nagpa targets one creature it can see within 90 feet of it. The target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. An evil creature makes the save with disadvantage. On a failed save, the target is [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the nagpa until the start of the nagpa's next turn. On a successful save, the target becomes immune to the nagpa's Corruption for the next 24 hours.

***Paralysis (Recharge 6-6).*** The nagpa forces each creature within 30 feet of it to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, excluding Undead and Constructs. On a failed save, a target is [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. A [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
