## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The tlincalli makes one Longsword or Spiked Chain attack and one Sting attack.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) slashing damage, or 8 (`1d10 + 3`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Spiked Chain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 11) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the tlincalli can't use the spiked chain against another target.

***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. If it fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the target is also [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
