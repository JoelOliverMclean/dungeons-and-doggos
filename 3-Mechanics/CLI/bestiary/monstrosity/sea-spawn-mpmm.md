## Traits

***Limited Amphibiousness.*** The sea spawn can breathe air and water, but it needs to be submerged in the sea at least once a day for 1 minute to avoid suffocating.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sea spawn makes two Unarmed Strike attacks and one Piscine Anatomy attack.

***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) bludgeoning damage.

***Piscine Anatomy.*** The sea spawn uses one of the following options (choose one or roll a `d6`):

- **1–2 Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage.  
- **3–4 Poison Quills.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 3 (`1d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **5–6 Tentacle.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 12) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the sea spawn can't use this tentacle on another target.
