## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** The choldrith has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put the choldrith to sleep.

***Spider Climb.*** The choldrith can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the choldrith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the choldrith knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The choldrith ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

***Spellcasting.*** The choldrith casts one of the following spells, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

**At will**: [guidance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance.md), [thaumaturgy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thaumaturgy.md)

**1/day each**: [bane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bane.md), [hold person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md)

## Actions

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) poison damage.

***Web (Recharge 5-6).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* The target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by webbing. As an action, the [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) target can make a DC 11 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; 5 hit points; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

## Bonus Actions

***Spectral Dagger (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The choldrith conjures a floating, spectral dagger within 60 feet of itself. The choldrith can make a melee spell attack (+4 to hit) against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger. On a hit, the target takes 6 (`1d8 + 2`) force damage.

The dagger lasts for 1 minute. As a bonus action on later turns, the choldrith can move the dagger up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger.
