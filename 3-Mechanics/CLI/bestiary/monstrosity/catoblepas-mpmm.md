## Traits

***Stench.*** Any creature other than a catoblepas that starts its turn within 10 feet of the catoblepas must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Stench of any catoblepas for 1 hour.

## Actions

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (`5d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the start of the catoblepas's next turn.

***Death Ray (Recharge 5-6).*** The catoblepas targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (`8d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target instead takes 64 necrotic damage. The target dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this ray.
