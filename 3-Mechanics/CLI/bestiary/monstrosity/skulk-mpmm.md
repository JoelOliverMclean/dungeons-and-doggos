## Traits

***Fallible Invisibility.*** The skulk is [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible). This invisibility can be circumvented by three things:

- **Charnel Candles.** The skulk appears as a dim, translucent form in the light of a candle made of fat rendered from a corpse whose identity is unknown.  
- **Children.** Humanoid children, aged 10 and under, can see through this invisibility.  
- **Reflective Surfaces.** The skulk appears as a drab, smoothskinned biped if its reflection can be seen in a mirror or on another surface.  

***Trackless.*** The skulk leaves no tracks to indicate where it has been or where it's headed.

## Actions

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) slashing damage plus 3 (`1d6`) necrotic damage.
