# Yuan-ti Pit Master
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 206*  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/bestiary/VGM/Yuan-ti%20Pit%20Master.webp#right)  
Yuan-ti malisons who become priestly devotees of a particular god-be it Sseth, Dendar the Night Serpent, or Merrshaulk-often rise through the ranks to become spiritual leaders among the serpent folk. These priests perform sacrificial rites to appease their vile gods.

## Yuan-ti Pit Master

Pit masters are yuan-ti malison priests that have made a pact with the god Merrshaulk and seek to rouse him from his slumber by sacrificing humanoids to him. They are the most traditionalist in attitude among yuan-ti and believe that they are best equipped to achieve the goals of their people.

Pit masters are deeply involved in the race's long-term plan to take over humanoid governments, as well as in the ongoing effort to protect their cities from discovery or attacks by hostiles. They oppose reckless behavior and argue for a slow, cautious approach in all matters.

This malison is the type that has a human head and body and snakes for arms.

***Merrshaulk's Slumber (1/Day).*** The yuan-ti targets up to five creatures that it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall into a magical sleep and be [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 10 minutes. A sleeping target awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.
