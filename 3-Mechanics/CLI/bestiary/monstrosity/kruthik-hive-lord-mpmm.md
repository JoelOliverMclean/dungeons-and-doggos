***Pack Tactics.*** The kruthik has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the kruthik's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Tunneler.*** The kruthik can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The kruthik makes two Stab or Spike attacks.

***Stab.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d10 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Spike.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Acid Spray (Recharge 5-6).*** The kruthik sprays acid in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (`4d10`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
