## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The froghemoth can breathe air and water.

***Shock Susceptibility.*** If the froghemoth takes lightning damage, it suffers two effects until the end of its next turn: its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The froghemoth makes one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks, and it can use Tongue.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`3d10 + 6`) piercing damage, and the target is swallowed if it is a Medium or smaller creature. A swallowed creature is [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the froghemoth, and takes 10 (`3d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the froghemoth's turns.

The froghemoth's gullet can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the froghemoth takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the froghemoth must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the froghemoth. If the froghemoth dies, any swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`3d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 16) if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the froghemoth can't use this tentacle on another target. The froghemoth has four tentacles.

***Tongue.*** The froghemoth targets one Medium or smaller creature that it can see within 20 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the froghemoth.
