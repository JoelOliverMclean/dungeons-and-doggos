## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The anathema has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Ophidiophobia Aura.*** Any creature of the anathema's choice, other than a snake or a yuan-ti, that starts its turn within 30 feet of the anathema must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of snakes and yuan-ti. A [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this anathama's aura for the next 24 hours.

***Six Heads.*** The anathema has advantage on saves against being [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned), or knocked [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious).

***Spellcasting (Anathema Form Only).*** The anathema casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [animal friendship](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/animal-friendship.md) (snakes only)

**3/day each**: [darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md), [entangle](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/entangle.md), [fear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear.md), [polymorph](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph.md), [suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack (Anathema Form Only).*** The anathema makes two Claw attacks and one Flurry of Bites attack.

***Claw (Anathema Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d6 + 6`) slashing damage.

***Flurry of Bites (Anathema Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 27 (`6d6 + 6`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) poison damage.

***Constrict (Snake Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* 16 (`3d6 + 6`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`2d6`) acid damage, and the target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and it takes 16 (`3d6 + 6`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`2d6`) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The anathema can constrict only one creature at a time.

## Bonus Actions

***Change Shape.*** The anathema transforms into a Huge constrictor snake or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
