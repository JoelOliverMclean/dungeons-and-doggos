## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The clockwork has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Unusual Nature.*** The clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, it is knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Reactions

***Intercept Attack.*** In response to another creature within 5 feet of it being hit by an attack roll, the clockwork gives that creature a +5 bonus to its AC against that attack, potentially causing a miss. To use this ability, the clockwork must be able to see the creature and the attacker.
