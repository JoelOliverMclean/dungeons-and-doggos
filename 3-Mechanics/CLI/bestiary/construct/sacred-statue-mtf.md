## Traits

***False Appearance.*** While the statue remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue.

***Ghostly Inhabitant.*** The [eidolon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/eidolon-mtf.md) that enters the sacred statue remains inside it until the statue drops to 0 hit points, the eidolon uses a bonus action to move out of the statue, or the eidolon is turned or forced out by an effect such as the [dispel evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md) spell. When the eidolon leaves the statue, it appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the statue.

***Inert.*** When not inhabited by an [eidolon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/eidolon-mtf.md), the statue is an object.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The statue makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 43 (`6d12 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 37 (`6d10 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.
