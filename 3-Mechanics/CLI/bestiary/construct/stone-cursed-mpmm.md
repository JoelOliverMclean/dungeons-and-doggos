## Traits

***Cunning Opportunist.*** The stone cursed has advantage on the attack rolls of opportunity attacks.

***False Appearance.*** If the stone cursed is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the stone cursed move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern that the stone cursed isn't a statue.

***Unusual Nature.*** The stone cursed doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Petrifying Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d8 + 3`) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the end of its next turn, when it must repeat the saving throw. The effect ends if the second save is successful; otherwise the target is [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) for 24 hours.
