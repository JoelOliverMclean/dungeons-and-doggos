## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The steel predator has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Unusual Nature.*** The steel predator doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Spellcasting.*** The steel predator casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability:

**3/day each**: [dimension door](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dimension-door.md) (self only), [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The steel predator makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`2d10 + 7`) lightning damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d8 + 7`) force damage.

***Stunning Roar (Recharge 5-6).*** The steel predator emits a roar in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (`6d10`) thunder damage, drops everything it's holding, and is [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. The [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned).
