# Duergar Hammerer
*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 188*  

## Duergar Hammerer

The hammerer is a digging machine with a duergar strapped inside it—typically a punishment for those whose work ethic wavers. The machine's mechanism transforms the captive duergar's pain into energy that powers the device, which is typically used to dig tunnels and repel invaders.

The cruel duergar plot not only to defeat other dwarves, but to cast down the entire dwarven pantheon in revenge for their being abandoned and left to be enslaved by mind flayers. To this end, duergar train warriors to fulfill a variety of roles.
