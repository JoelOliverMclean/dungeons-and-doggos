## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The clockwork has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Unusual Nature.*** The clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The clockwork makes two Lancing Bolt attacks or one Lancing Bolt attack and one Harpoon attack.

***Lancing Bolt.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Harpoon.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 50/200 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d10 + 4`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 12). While [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) in this way, a creature's speed isn't reduced, but it can move only in directions that bring it closer to the clockwork. A creature takes 5 (`1d10`) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. The clockwork can grapple only one creature at a time with its harpoon.

***Explosive Bolt (Recharge 5-6).*** The clockwork launches an explosive charge at a point within 120 feet. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (`5d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Bonus Actions

***Reel In.*** The clockwork pulls the creature [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by its Harpoon up to 20 feet closer.
