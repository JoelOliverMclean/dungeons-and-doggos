## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The wastrilith can breathe air and water.

***Corrupt Water.*** At the start of each of the wastrilith's turns, exposed water within 30 feet of it is befouled. Underwater, this effect lightly obscures the area until a current clears it away. Water in containers remains corrupted until it evaporates.

A creature that consumes this foul water or swims in it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the foul water for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (`4d6`) poison damage and is [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (`4d8`) poison damage and is [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until it finishes a long rest.

If another demon drinks the foul water as an action, it gains 11 (`2d10`) temporary hit points.

***Magic Resistance.*** The wastrilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The wastrilith makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, and it uses Grasping Spout.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (`4d12 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`4d6 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Grasping Spout.*** The wastrilith magically launches a spout of water at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw, and it has disadvantage if it's underwater. On a failed save, it takes 22 (`4d8 + 4`) acid damage and is pulled up to 60 feet toward the wastrilith. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

## Bonus Actions

***Undertow.*** If the wastrilith is underwater, it causes all water within 60 feet of it to be difficult terrain for other creatures until the start of its next turn.
