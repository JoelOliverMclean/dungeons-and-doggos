## Traits

***Immobilizing Fear.*** When a creature that isn't a demon starts its turn within 30 feet of one or more rutterkins, that creature must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. The creature has disadvantage on the save if it's within 30 feet of six or more rutterkins. On a failed save, the creature becomes [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the rutterkins for 1 minute. While [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) in this way, the creature is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). At the end of each of the [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the Crippling Fear of all rutterkins for 24 hours.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`3d6 + 2`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). At the end of each long rest, the [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, it dies and instantly transforms into a living [manes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/manes.md). The transformation can be undone only by a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell.
