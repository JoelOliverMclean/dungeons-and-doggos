## Traits

***Rotting Presence.*** When any creature that isn't a demon starts its turn within 30 feet of the bulezau, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (`1d6`) necrotic damage.

***Standing Leap.*** The bulezau's long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

***Sure-Footed.*** The bulezau has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Actions

***Barbed Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d12 + 2`) piercing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the disease ends. While [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, the target sports festering boils, coughs up flies, and sheds rotting skin, and the target must repeat the saving throw after every 24 hours that elapse. On a successful save, the disease ends. On a failed save, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by 4 (`1d8`). The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
