## Hydroloth

Like the thought-stealing waters of the River Styx they inhabit, hydroloths filch the memories of creatures they attack, stealing away their thoughts for delivery to whatever master they happen to serve. Hydroloths are skilled at finding lost things, especially those that have been swallowed up in the deeps.

For amphibious assaults or underwater conflicts, hydroloths have no equal among yugoloths. They sometimes hire themselves out to attack and scuttle ships and raid coastal settlements.

## Yugoloths

Mercenaries that ply their trade throughout the Lower Planes and in other realms, yugoloths have a reputation for effectiveness that is matched only by their desire for ever more wealth. Although yugoloths aren't especially loyal and typically try to exploit every potential loophole in a contract, they undertake any task for which they are hired, no matter how despicable. Yugoloths come in a wide variety of forms, including those described in the Monster Manual and the six creatures presented here.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The hydroloth can breathe air and water.

***Magic Resistance.*** The hydroloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The hydroloth's weapon attacks are magical.

***Secure Memory.*** The hydroloth is immune to the waters of the River Styx as well as any effect that would steal or modify its memories or detect or read its thoughts.

***Watery Advantage.*** While submerged in liquid, the hydroloth has advantage on attack rolls.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hydroloth's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md), [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md) (self only), [water walk](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/water-walk.md)

**3/day each**: [control water](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-water.md), [crown of madness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/crown-of-madness.md), [fear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear.md), [phantasmal killer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/phantasmal-killer.md), [suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hydroloth makes two melee attacks. In place of one of these attacks, it can cast one spell that takes 1 action to cast.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d8 + 5`) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d10 + 5`) piercing damage.

***Steal Memory (1/Day).*** The hydroloth targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target takes `4d6` psychic damage, and it must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the target becomes immune to this hydroloth's Steal Memory for 24 hours. On a failed save, the target loses all proficiencies, it can't cast spells, it can't understand language, and if its Intelligence and Charisma scores are higher than 5, they become 5. Each time the target finishes a long rest, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. A [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) or [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell cast on the target ends this effect early.

***Teleport.*** The hydroloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
