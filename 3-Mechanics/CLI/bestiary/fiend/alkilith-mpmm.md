## Traits

***Abyssal Rift.*** If the alkilith surrounds a door, window, or similar opening continuously for `6d6` days, the opening becomes a permanent portal to a random layer of the Abyss.

***Amorphous.*** The alkilith can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***False Appearance.*** If the alkilith is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the alkilith move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern that the alkilith isn't ordinary slime or fungus.

***Foment Confusion.*** Any creature that isn't a demon that starts its turn within 30 feet of the alkilith must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, or it hears a faint buzzing in its head for a moment and has disadvantage on its next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.

If the saving throw against Foment Confusion fails by 5 or more, the creature is instead subjected to the [confusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md) spell for 1 minute (no [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) required by the alkilith). While under the effect of that confusion, the creature is immune to Foment Confusion.

***Magic Resistance.*** The alkilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spider Climb.*** The alkilith can climb difficult surfaces, such as upside down on ceilings, without making an ability check.

***Unusual Nature.*** The alkilith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The alkilith makes three Tentacle attacks.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`4d6 + 4`) acid damage.
