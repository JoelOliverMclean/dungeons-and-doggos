## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) poison damage.

***Abyssal Curse.*** The vargouille targets one [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) Humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a [daylight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/daylight.md) spell; don't count that time. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md), [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md), or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.

***Stunning Shriek (Recharge 5-6).*** The vargouille shrieks. Each Humanoid and Beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the vargouille until the end of the vargouille's next turn. While [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) in this way, a target is [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned). If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for 1 hour.
