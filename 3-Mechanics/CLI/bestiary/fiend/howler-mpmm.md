## Traits

***Pack Tactics.*** A howler has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the howler's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The howler makes two Rending Bite attacks.

***Rending Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) piercing damage, plus 22 (`4d10`) psychic damage if the target is [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened). This attack ignores damage resistance.

***Mind-Breaking Howl (Recharge 4-6).*** The howler emits a keening howl in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 16 (`3d10`) psychic damage and be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the end of the howler's next turn. While a creature is [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) in this way, its speed is halved, and it is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). A target that successfully saves is immune to the Mind-Breaking Howl of all howlers for the next 24 hours.
