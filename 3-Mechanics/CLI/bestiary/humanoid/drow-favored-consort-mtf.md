## Drow Favored Consort

Nearly all priestesses of Lolth, including the powerful matron mothers, take attractive drow as their consorts. Often these individuals serve no purpose beyond pleasure, breeding, or both, but sometimes consorts can gain the ear of their priestess and be relied on to provide useful advice. No position of consort is assured for long; priestesses are infamous for being fickle with their favor, which are they are especially glad to lavish on a consort who combines beauty with magical might.

***Hand Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d6 + 5`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) while [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way.
