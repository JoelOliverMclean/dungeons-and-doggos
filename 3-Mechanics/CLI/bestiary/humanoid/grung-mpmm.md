## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The grung can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Standing Leap.*** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Water Dependency.*** If the grung isn't immersed in water for at least 1 hour during a day, it suffers 1 level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) at the end of that day. The grung can recover from this [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.

## Actions

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage plus 5 (`2d4`) poison damage.
