## Traits

***Burden of Time.*** Beasts and Humanoids (except elves) have disadvantage on saving throws while within 10 feet of the shadar-kai.

***Fey Ancestry.*** The shadar-kai has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put it to sleep.

***Spellcasting.*** The shadar-kai casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**At will**: [arcane eye](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-eye.md), [mage armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-armor.md), [minor illusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md), [prestidigitation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation.md), [speak with dead](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-dead.md)

**1/day each**: [arcane gate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-gate.md), [bane](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bane.md), [confusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md), [darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md), [fear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear.md), [major image](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image.md), [true seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-seeing.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shadar-kai makes three Shadow Spear attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

***Shadow Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120, one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus 26 (`4d12`) necrotic damage. Hit or Miss: The spear magically returns to the shadar-kai's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

## Reactions

***Misty Escape (Recharge 6-6).*** When the shadar-kai takes damage, it turns [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) and teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It remains [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until the start of its next turn or until it attacks or casts a spell.
