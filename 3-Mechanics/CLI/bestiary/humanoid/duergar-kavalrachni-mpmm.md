## Traits

***Cavalry Training.*** When the duergar hits a target with a melee attack while mounted, the mount can use its reaction to make one melee attack against the same target.

***Duergar Resilience.*** The duergar has advantage on saving throws against spells and the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), and [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) conditions.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The duergar makes two War Pick attacks.

***War Pick.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage plus 5 (`2d4`) poison damage.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d10`) piercing damage.

***Shared Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The duergar magically turns [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it forces a creature to make a saving throw, or its [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) with it. While the [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) duergar is mounted, the mount is [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) as well. The invisibility ends early on the mount immediately after it attacks.
