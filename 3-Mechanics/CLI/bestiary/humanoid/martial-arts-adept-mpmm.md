## Traits

***Unarmored Defense.*** While the adept is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The adept makes three Unarmed Strike attacks or five Dart attacks.

***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) bludgeoning damage. Once per turn, the adept can cause one of the following additional effects (choose one or roll a `d4`):

- **1–2 Knock Down..** The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).  
- **3–4 Push..** The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet directly away from the adept.  

***Dart.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage.

## Reactions

***Deflect Missile.*** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, the adept deflects the missile. The damage it takes from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + 3`. If the damage is reduced to 0, the adept catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and the adept has a hand free.
