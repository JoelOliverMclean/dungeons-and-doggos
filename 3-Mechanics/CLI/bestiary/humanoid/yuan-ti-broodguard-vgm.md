# Yuan-ti Broodguard

Yuan-ti malisons who become priestly devotees of a particular god-be it Sseth, Dendar the Night Serpent, or Merrshaulk-often rise through the ranks to become spiritual leaders among the serpent folk. These priests perform sacrificial rites to appease their vile gods.

## Yuan-ti Broodguard

Broodguards are humanoids transformed by yuan-ti into simple-minded, scaly creatures that do their masters' bidding. The transformation process warps not only a subject's body but also its mind, making it instinctively obey any yuan-ti and filling it with a seething rage that rises at the sight of non-reptilian creatures.

Although broodguards have low intelligence, they are able to perform simple yet important tasks in the community, such as guarding eggs or patrolling for intruders. The yuan-ti refer to broodguards as "histachii," which means "egg-watchers."

### Human No More

Most broodguards are made from human prisoners forced to consume a magical brew that renders them helpless and unable to fight off the inevitable. A human transformed into a broodguard loses all semblance of who it once was, and even its human origin is barely discernible. A broodguard is hairless and emaciated, with yellow-green, scaly skin. It has beady, bloodshot eyes and a forked tongue, and smells faintly of rotting meat. Broodguards can speak but rarely do so, preferring to use snake-like hisses and guttural noises.

## Making a Broodguard

Yuan-ti create broodguards from captured humanoids. Each subject is fed a special potion that immediately renders it [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and transforms it into a broodguard over the next `1d6 + 6` days. A subject forced to imbibe the brew can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; on a success, it takes 14 (`4d6`) poison damage and isn't otherwise affected.

A spell such as lesser restoration or remove curse can end the transformation process at any time before it runs its course. After the process is complete, only a [wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell can reverse the effect.
