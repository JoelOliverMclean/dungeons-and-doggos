***Spellcasting.*** The bard casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

**At will**: [dancing lights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md), [mage hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md), [prestidigitation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation.md)

**1/day each**: [charm person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md), [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [sleep](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sleep.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bard makes two Shortsword or Shortbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Cacophony (Recharge 4-6).*** Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from the bard must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 9 (`2d8`) thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the bard. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

## Bonus Actions

***Taunt (2/Day).*** The bard targets one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard's next turn.
