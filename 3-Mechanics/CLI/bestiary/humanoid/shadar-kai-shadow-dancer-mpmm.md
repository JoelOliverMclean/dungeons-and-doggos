## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** The shadar-kai has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put it to sleep.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shadar-kai makes three Spiked Chain attacks.

It can use Shadow Jump after one of these attacks.

***Spiked Chain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or suffer one of the following effects (choose one or roll a `d6`):

- **1–2 Decay.** The target takes 22 (`4d10`) necrotic damage.  
- **3–4 Grapple.** The target is [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the shadar-kai can't grapple another target.  
- **5–6 Topple.** The target is knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).  

## Bonus Actions

***Shadow Jump.*** The shadar-kai teleports, along with any equipment is it wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Both the space it teleports from and the space it teleports to must be in dim light or darkness.
