## Traits

***Whispering Aura.*** At the start of each of the warlock's turns, each creature of its choice within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) psychic damage, provided that the warlock isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Spellcasting.*** The warlock casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15): 

**At will**: [detect magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), [guidance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance.md), [levitate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate.md), [mage armor](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-armor.md) (self only), [mage hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md), [minor illusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md), [prestidigitation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/prestidigitation.md)

**1/day each**: [arcane gate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/arcane-gate.md), [detect thoughts](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [true seeing](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-seeing.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The warlock makes two Dagger attacks.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) psychic damage.

***Howling Void.*** The warlock opens a momentary extraplanar rift within 60 feet of it. The rift is a scream-filled, 20-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 9 (`2d8`) psychic damage and is [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the warlock until the start of the warlock's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened).
