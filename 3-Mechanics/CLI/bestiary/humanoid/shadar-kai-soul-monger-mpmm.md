## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** The shadar-kai has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put it to sleep.

***Magic Resistance.*** The shadar-kai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Soul Thirst.*** When it reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the shadar-kai can gain temporary hit points equal to half the creature's hit point maximum. While the shadar-kai has temporary hit points from this trait, it has advantage on attack rolls.

***Weight of Ages.*** Any Beast or Humanoid (except an elf) that starts its turn within 5 feet of the shadar-kai has its speed reduced by 20 feet until the start of that creature's next turn.

***Spellcasting.*** The shadar-kai casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**1/day each**: [bestow curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bestow-curse.md), [finger of death](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/finger-of-death.md), [gaseous form](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gaseous-form.md), [seeming](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/seeming.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shadar-kai makes two Shadow Dagger attacks.

***Shadow Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`4d4 + 3`) piercing damage plus 19 (`3d12`) necrotic damage, and the target has disadvantage on saving throws until the end of the shadar-kai's next turn. Hit or Miss: The dagger magically returns to the shadar-kai's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

***Wave of Weariness (Recharge 4-6).*** The shadar-kai emits weariness in a 60-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (`10d8`) psychic damage and suffers 1 level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and doesn't gain a level of [exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).
