## Githyanki Kith'rak

The githyanki's militarized culture assigns ranks and responsibilities to its citizens. Groups of ten warriors follow the commands of the sarths (githyanki warriors), while ten sarths obey the commands of the mighty kith'rak. These champions earn their status through torturous training and psionic testing until they can command the respect of their underlings.

## Gith

The descendants of an ancient people—so old their original name has been lost—have turned against each other, becoming vicious enemies divided over mortality, purpose, and the machinations of their leaders. The bellicose githyanki terrorize the Astral Plane, raiding into other worlds to plunder the multiverse of its magic and riches. The githzerai live apart from the rest of the cosmos, content within the confines of their fortresses floating through the chaos of Limbo. Although the two groups of gith despise each other, their hatred for the mind flayers from whom they escaped endures, and both githyanki and githzerai are dedicated to hunting their ancestral foes.
