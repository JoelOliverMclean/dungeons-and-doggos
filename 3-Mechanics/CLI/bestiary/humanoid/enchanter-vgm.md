# Enchanter
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 213*  

Enchanters are specialist wizards who understand how to alter and control minds using magic. They might be personable and interesting, using magic to manipulate people only when banter and conventional persuasion fails, or they might be rude and demanding, using and relying on [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), obedient minions.

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [hold person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md)*, [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md)*

*Enchantment spell of 1st level or higher

## Actions

***Quarterstaff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2 (`1d6 - 1`) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (`1d8 - 1`) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.

## Reactions

***Instinctive Charm (Recharges after the Enchanter Casts an Enchantment Spell of 1st level or Higher).*** The enchanter tries to magically divert an attack made against it, provided that the attacker is within 30 feet of it and visible to it. The enchanter must decide to do so before the attack hits or misses.

The attacker must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker targets the creature closest to it, other than the enchanter or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.
