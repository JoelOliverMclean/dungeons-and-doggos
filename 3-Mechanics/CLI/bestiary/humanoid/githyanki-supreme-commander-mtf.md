## Githyanki Supreme Commander

Supreme commanders lead the githyanki armies, each one commanding ten kith'raks, who in turn lead the rest of their forces. Most supreme commanders ride red dragons into battle.

## Gith

The descendants of an ancient people—so old their original name has been lost—have turned against each other, becoming vicious enemies divided over mortality, purpose, and the machinations of their leaders. The bellicose githyanki terrorize the Astral Plane, raiding into other worlds to plunder the multiverse of its magic and riches. The githzerai live apart from the rest of the cosmos, content within the confines of their fortresses floating through the chaos of Limbo. Although the two groups of gith despise each other, their hatred for the mind flayers from whom they escaped endures, and both githyanki and githzerai are dedicated to hunting their ancestral foes.

***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The githyanki's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

**At will**: [mage hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md) (the hand is invisible)

**1/day each**: [Bigby's hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bigbys-hand.md), [mass suggestion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mass-suggestion.md), [plane shift](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md), [telekinesis](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/telekinesis.md)

**3/day each**: [jump](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/jump.md), [levitate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate.md) (self only), [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step.md), [nondetection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/nondetection.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The githyanki makes two greatsword attacks.

***Silver Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d6 + 7`) slashing damage plus 17 (`5d6`) psychic damage. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the [astral projection](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/astral-projection.md) spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The githyanki adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the githyanki must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack (2 Actions).*** The githyanki makes a greatsword attack.

***Command Ally.*** The githyanki targets one ally it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see or hear the githyanki, the target can make one melee weapon attack using its reaction and has advantage on the attack roll.

***Teleport.*** The githyanki magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing and carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it. It also becomes insubstantial until the start of its next turn. While insubstantial, it can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 16 (`3d10`) force damage and is moved to the nearest unoccupied space.
