## Traits

***Firearms Knowledge.*** The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of muskets and pistols.

***Headfirst Charge.*** The giff can try to knock a creature over; if the giff moves at least 20 feet in a straight line and ends within 5 feet of a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giff makes two Longsword, Musket, or Pistol attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage, or 9 (`1d10 + 4`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Musket.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d12 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Pistol.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Fragmentation Grenade (1/Day).*** The giff throws a grenade up to 60 feet, and the grenade explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (`5d6`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
