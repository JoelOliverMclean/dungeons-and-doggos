## Drow Arachnomancer

Drow spellcasters who seek to devote themselves wholly to the Spider Queen sometimes walk the dark path of the arachnomancer. By offering up body and soul to Lolth, they gain tremendous power and a supernatural connection to the ancient spiders of the Demonweb Pits, channeling magic from that dread place.

## Traits

***Change Shape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The drow can use a bonus action to magically polymorph into a [giant spider](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md), remaining in that form for up to 1 hour. It can revert to its true form as a bonus action. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. It can speak and cast spells while in giant spider form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying in humanoid form melds into the giant spider form. It can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. It reverts to its humanoid form if it dies.

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Spider Climb.*** The drow can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Web Walker.*** The drow ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [dancing lights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md)

**1/day each**: [darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md), [faerie fire](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/faerie-fire.md), [levitate](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate.md) (self only)

***Spellcasting.*** The drow is a 16th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

**1/day**: [eyebite](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/eyebite.md), [etherealness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/etherealness.md), [dominate monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-monster.md)

**Cantrips (at will)**: [chill touch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/chill-touch.md), [eldritch blast](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/eldritch-blast.md), [mage hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md), [poison spray](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/poison-spray.md)

**1st-5th level (3 slots)**: [conjure animals](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-animals.md) (spiders only), [crown of madness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/crown-of-madness.md), [dimension door](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dimension-door.md), [dispel magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), [fear](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear.md), [fly](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly.md), [giant insect](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/giant-insect.md), [hold monster](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-monster.md), [insect plague](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/insect-plague.md), [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility.md), [vampiric touch](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/vampiric-touch.md), [web](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/web.md), [witch bolt](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/witch-bolt.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The drow makes two poisonous touch attacks or two bite attacks. The first of these attacks that hits each round deals an extra 26 (`4d12`) poison damage to the target.

***Poisonous Touch (Humanoid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (`8d6`) poison damage.

***Bite (Giant Spider Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d8 + 3`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 26 (`4d12`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way.

***Web (Giant Spider Form Only Recharge 5â€“6).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* The target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by webbing. As an action, the [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) target can make a DC 15 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
