## Traits

***False Appearance.*** If the slithering tracker is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the slithering tracker move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern that the slithering tracker isn't a puddle.

***Liquid Form.*** The slithering tracker can enter an enemy's space and stop there. It can also move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Spider Climb.*** The slithering tracker can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d10 + 3`) bludgeoning damage.

***Life Leech.*** One Large or smaller creature that the slithering tracker can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. In addition, the [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) target takes 16 (`3d10`) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The slithering tracker can grapple only one target at a time.

While grappling the target, the slithering tracker takes only half any damage dealt to it (rounded down), and the target takes the other half.

## Bonus Actions

***Watery Stealth.*** If underwater, the slithering tracker takes the [Hide](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Hide) action, and it makes the Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check with advantage.
