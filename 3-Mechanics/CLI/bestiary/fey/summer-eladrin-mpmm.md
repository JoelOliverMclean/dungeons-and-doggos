## Traits

***Fearsome Presence.*** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the eladrin for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any eladrin's Fearsome Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Magic Resistance.*** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The eladrin makes two Longsword or Longbow attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) slashing damage, or 15 (`2d10 + 4`) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 9 (`2d8`) fire damage.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d8 + 5`) piercing damage plus 9 (`2d8`) fire damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).*** The eladrin teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The eladrin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the eladrin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
