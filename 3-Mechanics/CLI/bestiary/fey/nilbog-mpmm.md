## Traits

***Nilbogism.*** Any creature that attempts to damage the nilbog must first succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) until the end of the creature's next turn. A creature [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way must use its action praising the nilbog.

The nilbog can't regain hit points, including through magical healing, except through its Reversal of Fortune reaction.

***Spellcasting.*** The nilbog casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

**At will**: [mage hand](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mage-hand.md), [Tasha's hideous laughter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tashas-hideous-laughter.md)

## Actions

***Fool's Scepter.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage.

***Mocking Word.*** The nilbog targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (`2d4`) psychic damage and have disadvantage on its next attack roll before the end of its next turn.

## Bonus Actions

***Nimble Escape.*** The nilbog takes the [Disengage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage) or [Hide](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Hide) action.

## Reactions

***Reversal of Fortune.*** In response to another creature dealing damage to the nilbog, the nilbog reduces the damage to 0 and regains 3 (`1d6`) hit points.
