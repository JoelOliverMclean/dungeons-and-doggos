## Autumn Eladrin

Eladrin often enter the autumn season when they are overcome by feelings of goodwill. In this aspect, they defuse conflicts and alleviate suffering by using their magic to heal, to cure, and to relieve any ailment that might afflict the people who come to them for aid. They tolerate no violence in their presence and move quickly to settle disputes, to ensure that peace continues to reign.

## Eladrin

Eladrin dwell in the verdant splendor of the Feywild. They are related to the elves found on the Material Plane, and resemble them in both their love of beauty and the value they place on personal freedom. But where other elves can temper their wild impulses, eladrin are creatures ruled by emotion—and because of their unique magical nature, they undergo physical changes to match their changes in temperament.

The eladrin have spent centuries in the Feywild, and most of them have become fey creatures as a result. Some of them are still humanoid, similar in that respect to their other elven kin. The eladrin presented here are of the fey variety.

## Creatures of Passion

The magic flowing through eladrin responds to their emotional state by transforming them into different seasonal aspects, with behaviors and capabilities that change with their forms. Some eladrin might remain in a particular aspect for years, while others run through the emotional spectrum each week.

## Lovers of Beauty

Regardless of the aspect they express, eladrin love beauty and surround themselves with lovely things. Eladrin try to possess any objects they find striking. They might seek to own a painting, a statue, or a glittering jewel. When they encounter people of comely form or luminous spirit, they use their magic to delight those folk or, in the case of evil eladrin, to abduct them.

## Changeable Nature

Whenever one of the eladrin presented here finishes a long rest, it can associate itself with a different season, provided it isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). When the eladrin makes this change, it uses the stat block of the new season, rather than its old stat block. Any damage the eladrin sustained in its original form applies to the new form, as do any conditions or other ongoing effects affecting it.

## Traits

***Enchanting Presence.*** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the eladrin for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Enchanting Presence for 24 hours.

Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).*** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Magic Resistance.*** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The eladrin's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [calm emotions](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/calm-emotions.md), [sleep](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/sleep.md)

**1/day each**: [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md), [heal](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal.md), [raise dead](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/raise-dead.md)

**3/day each**: [cure wounds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cure-wounds.md) (as a 5th-level spell), [lesser restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md)

## Actions

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d8 + 1`) slashing damage plus 18 (`4d8`) psychic damage, or 6 (`1d10 + 1`) slashing damage plus 18 (`4d8`) psychic damage if used with two hands.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage plus 18 (`4d8`) psychic damage.

## Reactions

***Foster Peace.*** If a creature [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the eladrin hits with an attack roll while within 60 feet of the eladrin, the eladrin magically causes the attack to miss, provided the eladrin can see the attacker.
