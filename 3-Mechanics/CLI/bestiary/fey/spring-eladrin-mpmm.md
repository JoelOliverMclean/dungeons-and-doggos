## Traits

***Joyful Presence.*** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the eladrin for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Joyful Presence for 24 hours.

Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature, the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Magic Resistance.*** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The eladrin casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**At will**: [Tasha's hideous laughter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/tashas-hideous-laughter.md)
