## Traits

***Death Burn.*** When the darkling elder dies, magical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (`2d6`) radiant damage and is [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded).

***Darkness (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The darkling elder casts [darkness](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/darkness.md), requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.


## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The darkling elder makes two Scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) slashing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage.
