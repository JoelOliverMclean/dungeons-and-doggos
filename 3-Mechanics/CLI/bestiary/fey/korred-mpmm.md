## Traits

***Stone Camouflage.*** The korred has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in rocky terrain.

***Spellcasting.*** The korred casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

**At will**: [commune with nature](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/commune-with-nature.md) (as an action), [meld into stone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/meld-into-stone.md), [stone shape](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md)

**1/day**: [Otto's irresistible dance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ottos-irresistible-dance.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The korred makes two Greatclub or Rock attacks.

***Greatclub.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`1d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage, or 19 (`3d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage if the korred is on the ground.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 60/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`1d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage, or 19 (`3d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage if the korred is on the ground.

## Bonus Actions

***Command Hair.*** The korred has at least one 50-foot-long rope woven out of its hair. The korred commands one such rope within 30 feet of it to move up to 20 feet and entangle a Large or smaller creature that the korred can see. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become [grappled](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the rope (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). The korred can use a bonus action to release the target, which is also freed if the korred dies or becomes [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

A rope of korred hair has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point at the start of each of the korred's turns while the rope has at least 1 hit point and the korred is alive. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
