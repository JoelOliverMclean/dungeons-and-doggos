## Traits

***Enchanting Presence.*** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the eladrin for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Enchanting Presence for 24 hours.

Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature, the [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Magic Resistance.*** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The eladrin casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**At will**: [hold person](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person.md)

**1/day each**: [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md), [revivify](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/revivify.md)

**2/day each**: [cure wounds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cure-wounds.md) (as a 5th-level spell), [lesser restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The eladrin makes two Longsword or Longbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d8 + 1`) slashing damage, or 6 (`1d10 + 1`) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 22 (`5d8`) psychic damage.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage plus 22 (`5d8`) psychic damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).*** The eladrin teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

## Reactions

***Foster Peace.*** If a creature [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the eladrin hits with an attack roll while within 60 feet of the eladrin, the eladrin magically causes the attack to miss, provided the eladrin can see the attacker.
