_Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors_

Ulkoria (NG female shield dwarf [archmage](app://obsidian.md/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md)) has defended Waterdeep with her magic more times than she can recall. She's known as "the Gargoyle" because her face is frozen in a scowl that frightens adults and children alike. No one knows where she lives, but it's believed to be underground, possibly a cellar or dungeon under one of the city's oldest estates. She uses [teleport](app://obsidian.md/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/teleport.md) spells to enter and leave her home, and she's never seen without her [shield guardian](app://obsidian.md/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/shield-guardian.md) close by.

A little-known fact is that Ulkoria once owned the tavern in Trollskull Alley. She sold it to a family of shield dwarves, who fell on hard times and sold it to a woman who made it into an orphanage. "Turned out to be a hag who was cooking and eating the children," Ulkoria recalls. The estate passed through several more hands in the years that followed. Ulkoria hopes the new owners make something good of it.

Anytime she passes through the North Ward, Ulkoria stops by the tavern for a drink and to check out the place while her shield guardian waits outside. If she doesn't like what the characters have done with the establishment, she keeps her criticisms to herself. The characters can hire her to cast [glyphs of warding](app://obsidian.md/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) on the place, for which she charges 300 gp apiece.
