## Profile

> ### RP
> Accent: **`=this.accent`**

**Nar’l Xibrindas is a striking and enigmatic figure, known for his dark, brooding presence. With sharp features and a commanding posture, he exudes an aura of mystery and danger. His attire is always impeccably tailored, often in dark, muted colors that enhance his shadowy demeanor. Nar’l's piercing gaze and measured, deliberate speech suggest a mind constantly at work, navigating the intricate and dangerous underbelly of Waterdeep's politics and power. As a powerful and secretive player in the city’s shadows, he is both feared and respected.**
