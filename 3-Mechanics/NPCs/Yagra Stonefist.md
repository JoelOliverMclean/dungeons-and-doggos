**Yagra Stonefist is a formidable and imposing half-orc, known for her powerful build and unyielding demeanor. Her rough, battle-scarred appearance and fierce, piercing eyes reflect a life of combat and resilience. With her dark green skin and a pair of tusks jutting from her lower jaw, she exudes both strength and authority. Clad in practical, durable armor, Yagra commands respect and attention. As a tough enforcer for the Zhentarim, she is a force to be reckoned with, feared for her combat skills and unwavering loyalty.**
