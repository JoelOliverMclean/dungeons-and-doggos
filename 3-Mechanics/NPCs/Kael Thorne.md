# `=this.file.name`
## Profile

> ### RP
> Accent: **`=this.accent`**

**Dressed in black shadowy leather armour, veiled by an equally dark hooded cloak, clutching daggers in each hand, you see dark green eyes staring from above a tight bandana-like face covering as he crouches low the ground ready to attack.**

**Kael Thorne is a sleek and elusive half-elf rogue, his presence marked by a subtle air of danger. With sharp, angular features and a lithe, agile frame, he moves with the grace of a shadow. His dark, carefully styled hair and piercing eyes give him a cunning, calculated look. Clad in practical, well-fitted leather armor, Kael blends seamlessly into the night. As a skilled thief working for the Xanathar Guild, his expertise in stealth and deception is matched only by his cold, efficient demeanor. Always a step ahead, Kael is a master of navigating Waterdeepâ€™s underworld with ruthless precision.**
