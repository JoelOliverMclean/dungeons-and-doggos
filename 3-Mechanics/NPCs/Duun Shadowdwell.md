# `=this.file.name`
## Profile

> ### RP
> Accent: **`=this.accent`**

**Stocky and muscular, with a rough, heavily scarred face. His hair is dark gray, and his beard is long, braided with steel rings. He wears simple robes, but the gleam of chain mail can be seen beneath. His holy symbol (an anvil with a hammer) is always close at hand.**

**Gruff, stoic, but dependable. Duun prefers actions to words, though his dry wit slips out in short, sarcastic comments. He values loyalty and honor but is somewhat cynical from years of seeing the worst in people.**

## Meeting Duun
Duun was captured by the Xanathar Guild when he got caught up in a skirmish while aiding a small group of refugees near Waterdeep. As a wandering cleric of the god Moradin, he had made it his mission to offer healing and protection to the downtrodden, but he ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. The guild was targeting someone among the refugees for debts owed, and Duun, seeing the situation escalate, intervened on behalf of the innocents. His interference infuriated the guild, leading to his capture and imprisonment in their dungeon.

The Xanathar Guild didn't kill him because they thought they could either ransom him back to a dwarven clan or break his spirit to force him into service as a healer for their mercenaries. So far, he's resisted.
