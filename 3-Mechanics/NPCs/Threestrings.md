## Profile

> ### RP
> Accent: **`=this.accent`**

**Threestrings is a charismatic and scruffy bard with a roguish charm that draws people in. His disheveled appearance, with tousled hair and a weathered cloak, contrasts with his lively and engaging presence. He carries a lute with only three stringsâ€”an intentional quirk that adds to his distinctive character. His bright, expressive eyes and easy smile reveal a man who is both a skilled performer and a master storyteller. Threestrings is well-known in Waterdeep for his enchanting music and captivating tales, often seen weaving his magic through song and charm wherever he goes.**
